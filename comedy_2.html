ali wong  hi  hello  welcome  thank you  thank you for coming  hello  hello  we are gonna have to get this shit over with  \u2019cause i have to pee in  like  ten minutes  but thank you  everybody  so much for coming  um\u2026 it\u2019s a very exciting day for me  it\u2019s been a very exciting year for me  i turned   this year  yes  thank you  five people  i appreciate that  uh  i can tell that i\u2019m getting older  because  now  when i see an   year old girl  my automatic thought\u2026 is \u201cfuck you \u201d \u201cfuck you  i don\u2019t even know you  but fuck you \u201d \u2018cause i\u2019m straight up jealous  i\u2019m jealous  first and foremost  of their metabolism  because   year old girls  they could just eat like shit  and then they take a shit and have a six pack  right  they got that that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through \nand then  when they go to sleep  they just go to sleep  right  they don\u2019t have insomnia yet  they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind  they have their whole lives ahead of them  they don\u2019t have hpv yet  they just go to sleep in peace at night  everybody has hpv  ok  everybody has it  it\u2019s ok  come out already  everybody has it  if you don\u2019t have it yet  you go and get it  you go and get it  it\u2019s coming  you don\u2019t have hpv yet  you\u2019re a fucking loser  all right  that\u2019s what that says about you  a lot of men don\u2019t know that they have hpv  because it\u2019s undetectable in men  it\u2019s really fucked up  hpv is a ghost that lives inside men\u2019s bodies and says  \u201cboo \u201d in women\u2019s bodies  my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv  either i have the kind that\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\u2026 \u2026or i have the kind where my body will heal itself  very helpful  this doctor  right  so  basically  either i\u2019m gonna die\u2026 or you\u2019re in the presence of wolverine  bitches  we\u2019ll find out  um  i can also tell that i\u2019m getting older  because my kindle is turning into a self help library  i\u2019m not interested in books like fifty shades of grey  ok  i\u2019m interested in the life changing magic of tidying up  yes  yes  that\u2019s right  how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success  that\u2019s what your   is all about  how can i turn this shit around  i\u2019m a horrible person  i\u2019m not happy with where i am  how can i turn this shit around  help me  tony robbins  help me \ni have a hoarding problem  which i\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems  i\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away  the hpv will also disappear  i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything  because you never know when a dictator\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth  so  you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade  \u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communists \nthe last time i was at home in san francisco  i was trying to help her get rid of shit  don\u2019t ever do that with your mom  it was like the worst experience of my life  it was so emotional  we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments ti  \u2026 manual  the manual  she don\u2019t even know\u2026 where the calculator is  those of you under   probably don\u2019t know what that calculator is  it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation  we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade  it cost like     and everybody thought it was like this judy jetson\u2019s laptop from the future  all because what  it could graph  it was like the tesla of my time  and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like  \u201cyou never know when you might need this \u201d and i was like  \u201cbut\u2026 i do know\u2026 that i\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die \u201d \u201cand i\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore  because according to deepak oprah  that\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success \u201d i grew up a lot this past year  uh  this past year i also got married  yeah  to a man who now has hpv  very lucky guy  he gave me something  i gave him something  that will also last forever  no  really  i\u2019m the lucky girl  because before him  i dated a lot of losers  lots of losers  a lot of skaters  you wanna be a grown ass woman  stop dating skaters  stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen  they\u2019re sexy on the outside  malt liquor on the inside  horrible  but my husband  i first met him at this wedding and  uh  he\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s much better looking than me  he\u2019s way out of my league  and i saw him and i was like  \u201coh  my god  who is that \u201d and the first thing i learned about him was that  at the time  he was attending harvard business school  and i was like  \u201coh  my god  i\u2019m gonna trap his ass \u201d \u201cgoing to trap his ass \u201d and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date  which is a very unusual move on my part  but i did it on purpose  because i knew that he was a catch  so i was like  \u201call right  ali  you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden \u201d when  really  it\u2019s a public park\u2026 \u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\u2026 \u2026and has even accidentally let\u2026 two homeless people inside  i thought they were hipsters  ok  that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing\u2026 for my generation  you homeless or you a hipster  is that beard for fashion or for warmth  it happened to\u2026 it happened in san francisco  when i was living there  and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  like  we had\u2026 we had so much chemistry  he was like  \u201chey  wassup \u201d i was like  \u201cwassup \u201d and we\u2013 the next thing i knew  we were getting busy in the back of my volvo  and then after we were done  he was like  \u201chey  can you drop me off \u201d i was like  \u201cwhere \u201d he was like  \u201cat the park \u201d and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends  and i was like  \u201coh  no \u201d \u201ci just fucked a homeless dude  again \u201d my husband is asian  which a lot of people are shocked by  because  usually  asian american women who  like  you know  wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions  they like to date white dudes  you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory  it\u2019s\u2026 too much  i don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with these bitches  i get it  you know  because being with a white dude you feel very\u2026 you feel very picturesque when you\u2019re with a white dude  you know  you feel like you\u2019re in a wes anderson movie or something  and you know  white dudes  they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling  and disturbing documentaries  they introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\u2019s very  you know  it\u2019s hot hookin\u2019 up with a white dude  i mean  nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy  oh  my god  i just feel like i\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\u2026 \u2026you know  just right there  through the money hole and just\u2026 and then also  he\u2019s so vulnerable down there  i\u2019m  like  \u201ci could just crush your head at any moment  white man  i could just kill you right now  crush those brains  colonize the colonizer \u201d you know \nbut i think that for marriage  it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race  the advantage is that you get to go home\u2026 and be racist together  you get to say whatever you like  you don\u2019t gotta explain shit  my husband  half filipino  half japanese  i\u2019m half chinese and half vietnamese  and we spend   percent of our time shitting on korean people  it\u2019s\u2026 amazing  it\u2019s what love is built on  you know \nmy last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time  and i was like  \u201chold it  you guys aren\u2019t mexican \u201d asian american men are very underrated  i don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t go for them  they\u2019re the sexiest  asian men are the sexiest  they got no body hair from the neck down  it\u2019s like making love to a dolphin  oh  my god  it\u2019s so smooth  just like a slip and slide  just black fish  tilikum  all up in my bed every night  you know  ooh wee  you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards  it\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\u2019re like  \u201ci did not ask to be exfoliated today \u201d \u201cthis is the last time i go on j date  more like loofah date  thanks for the rug burn  avi \u201d and then asian men  no body odor  none  they just smell like responsibility  that\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from \ni think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  uh  between each other  because he\u2019s half filipino and half japanese and i\u2019m half chinese and half vietnamese  so  we\u2019re both half fancy asian\u2026 \u2026and half jungle asian  yeah  you guys know the difference  the fancy asians are the chinese  the japanese  they get to do fancy things like host olympics  jungle asians host diseases  it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s different  but he grew up on the east coast  going to private school  playing lacrosse  uh  you know  learning latin and playing chess and rugby  he grew up like filipino carlton  ok  so  he didn\u2019t know anything about vietnamese people until he met me  and on one of our first dates  he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show  he was like  \u201cit\u2019s authentic vietnamese  i read about it on yelp \u201d i was like  \u201cit\u2019s not authentic  ok \u201d you can tell  first and foremost  by the name  \u2019cause it don\u2019t got a number in it  second of all  you can tell by the bathroom  if it was legit  the bathroom would double as a supply closet  when i pee  i need to see ten gallons of bleach  an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner  and the wait staff here is too nice  we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused  i grew up going to private school  too  him and i are both total  like  private school asians  we both are big hippies  too  we like to backpack through southeast asia  we like to do yoga  we do ayahuasca ceremonies  we do silent meditation retreats  that\u2019s right  we pay    to shut up for a weekend  we do shit like that  uh  we eat gluten free  which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free range chewbacca  we eat that lesbian bread that\u2019s like\u2026 \u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\u2026 and   percent spoken word poetry  when you eat it  you queef a shitty poem about\u2026 \u2026supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever  and so  it\u2019s funny  right  because he\u2019s asian  too  but sometimes  all of this hippy dippy shit we do\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people  like  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean  we\u2019re like  \u201coh  that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier   imports  that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house  him and i had been dating for four years and i\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\u2026 because\u2026 i had been pressuring him to do it  so  you know  i just had this wacky women\u2019s intuition  that\u2019s how proposals really work  ok  a woman has to incept the idea into the man\u2019s head  first passively and then if he doesn\u2019t get the message  extremely aggressively  you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving  because you know that you\u2019re too old and it\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again  so  you\u2019re like  \u201ci\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude  focus on trapping this dude  and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like  \u201cshut the fuck up  fine  will you marry me \u201d and then afterwards  the woman is always  like  \u201coh  my god  he proposed \u201d \u201cit came outta nowhere  and look  he got me the exact ring i wanted  how did he know  maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something\u2026 that i sent to my best friend  that i told her to send to him every day \u201d let me tell you something  if a man has a pinterest page\u2026 he\u2019s probably pinterested in men  we got engaged on a saturday  i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday\u2026 because i had tried it on in    i was ready  i was ripe  i was rotten  i need to be made into banana bread  that\u2019s how rotten i was  people are always very surprised at how  off stage  with my husband  i\u2019m a completely different person  you\u2013 like  you would not recognize my personality at all with him  with him  i\u2019m very soft  and  like  very nurturing and very domestic  we\u2019ve been together now for five years  and for five years  i\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day  yeah  yes  yes  yes  i did that so that he\u2019d become dependent on me  \u2018cause he graduated from harvard business school  and i don\u2019t wanna work anymore  i don\u2019t  i straight up don\u2019t wanna work anymore  i don\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart  i do it as an investment in my financial future  \u2018cause i don\u2019t wanna work anymore  i\u2019ve been reading that book by sheryl sandberg  she\u2019s the c o o  of facebook  and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers  talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top  and her book is called lean in  well  i don\u2019t wanna lean in  ok  i wanna lie down  i want to lie the fuck down  i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women  our job used to be no job  we had it so good  we could have done the smart thing  which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like  \u201cwe\u2019re dumb women  we don\u2019t know how to do anything  so  i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen \u201d \u201c\u2018cause we\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility \u201d and then  all these women had to show off and be like  \u201cwe could do it  we could do anything \u201d \u201cbitch  shut up \u201d \u201cdon\u2019t tell them the secret \u201d they ruined it for us  and now we\u2019re expected to work  when i hear the phrase  \u201cdouble income household \u201d i wanna throw up  a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments  and they\u2019re like  \u201cbut  ali  we have so many more options now \u201d oh  you don\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free  unscheduled  unsupervised  and most importantly  sponsored  do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it \na lot of my friends  when we walk around together  they\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\u2019ll see on the street  and they\u2019ll be like  \u201clook at that fucking housewife  not doing anything  look at that housewife  just walking around all day  getting massages in her lululemon pants \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cthat bitch is a genius \u201d \u201cshe\u2019s not a housewife  she\u2019s retired \u201d\ni do write for fresh off the boat on abc  yeah  which is\u2026 it\u2019s a great show  i love it a lot  i love my co workers  it\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs  it\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for  but i still gotta work at a office every day  which means i gotta shit in a office every day  housewives  they don\u2019t gotta shit in a office  housewives get to shit in their house  skin to seat  they don\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover  they don\u2019t gotta\u2026 \u2026ten times a day  every day\u2026 like you\u2019re about to eat a sad ass meal  they don\u2019t gotta do that  they don\u2019t gotta use that one ply toilet paper  that office toilet paper  that they purposely make difficult to pull out  they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\u2019s not even effective  it basically just dehydrates your butt hole  it\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert  i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago  to try to make a macgyver baby wipe  to moisten it  and then it backfired \u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out  and then i had to start all over again  and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \u2019cause you\u2019re paranoid that your co worker\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall  and you\u2019re like  \u201coh  no  courtney\u2019s listening  she\u2019s waiting  she\u2019s timing me \u201d and then you hurry  hurry  hurry  and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long  and then if you dare scratch yourself  your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\u2019s been run over by the goonies  housewives  they don\u2019t gotta muffle their shit  too  they don\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out  they don\u2019t gotta try to  you know  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace  so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep  deep shame  housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want  they don\u2019t gotta take these boring  repressed shits  they can listen to podcasts  planet money  they can do whatever they want \nyou know  it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s very distracting for me when i hear my co workers blow ass into the toilet  i lose respect for them  nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence  i heard one of my co workers blow ass into the toilet the other day  this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say  \u201cyou need to get to work on time \u201d i was like  \u201cyou need to eat bananas \u201d \u201ci saw those green ballet flats  i know that shit was you  don\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together \u201d my father in law had this huge sit down with me and my husband recently  um  and he was like  \u201chey  i wanna talk to you guys about money  you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had \u201d i was like  \u201cwhy you telling me this shit  i should not be a part of this conversation  you tell you son that  don\u2019t your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential  why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life  i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement  and when i said  \u2018i do \u2019 what i really meant was  \u2018oh  i\u2019m done

a disgusting pervert  i\u2019m a pervert  i\u2019m a gross filthy animal  and i think it\u2019s because i started watching porn at a very young age  and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\u2026 y you get sicker  and sicker  and sicker  the images you crave get sicker  and sicker  and sicker  but it\u2019s ok  because the internet will always catch up to you \ni broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back  i was like  \u201cuh  you\u2019re a idiot  dude  do you realize that if i went on craigslist\u2026 and posted \u2018tiny asian female seeking anal\u2026\u2019 the internet would crash \u201d \u201cand all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode \u201d they would explode  a lot of women get really

you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re fucking different people  i was very sexually active in my    and as a result  i\u2019m a little bit\u2026 \u2026stretched out down there  ok  so  when i finally did anal  i just felt like i got a second chance at life  you know  i was  like  \u201coh  my god  it\u2019s like i\u2019m going back in time \u201d \u266a a whole new world \u266a it was magical  a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate  yeah  like a conqueror  i just wanted to\u2026 now  if you haven\u2019t done it before  ladies  go

all squirmy wormy because\u2026 they\u2019re scared  they\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed  and they like it  that then  it might mean that they\u2019re gay  and i like that fear  that shit turns me on  you know  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure  oh  my god  and you just see the look in the man\u2019s eye like he\u2019s discovered nirvana  and it\u2019s like you\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole  and then  you as the woman  in his eyes  just become the lord of the rim  you know  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me  when\u2013 when i\u2019ve asked him to spank me  this is what he does  \u201chey  hey  are you ok  are you all right  you know i respect you  right \u201d

bed  women who are c e o s  they just wanna be roughed around  they just want their\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\u2013 it\u2019s because we\u2019re so in control all the time  that

that woman who wrote lean in  has had such a big impact that now  because of her  there is a ban on the word \u201cbossy\u201d in elementary schools  because according to her  it\u2019s sexist to use the word \u201cbossy \u201d because boys are never called bossy  so  now  instead of saying  \u201cyou\u2019re bossy \u201d you\u2019re supposed to say  \u201cyou have executive leadership skills \u201d which is a very roundabout way of saying  \u201cyou\u2019re a little cunt \u201d i\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to  like  become a housewife  financially  you know  i want my husband to get us to  like  a certain point financially  i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango  know what i\u2019m talking about  i\u2019m talking about that whole foods mango  that    a box whole foods mango that was sliced by white people  that\u2019s the kind of income bracket i\u2019m striving for  that\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve made it  when you\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah  i want noah mango\u2026 \u2026rebecca kiwi  danielle pineapple  you know what else i want  i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk  see a quarter  and just keep on walking  like a princess  i have some useful advice for all my asian american brothers and sisters  yeah  never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran  so  i don\u2019t know if you guys can tell  but i am seven and a half months pregnant  yeah  it\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant  because female comics\u2026 don\u2019t get pregnant  just try to think of one  i dare you  there\u2019s\u2013 none of them  once they do get pregnant  they generally disappear  that\u2019s not the case with male comics  once they have a baby  they\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\u2019ll be like  \u201cguys  i just had this fucking baby  that baby\u2019s a little piece of shit  it\u2019s so annoying and boring \u201d and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  like  \u201cthat\u2019s hilarious  i identify \u201d and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden  meanwhile  the mom is at home  chapping her nipples  feeding the fucking baby  and wearing a frozen diaper \u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\u2019s head shredding it up  she\u2019s busy  so  i don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen to me  you know  a lot of my female stand up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid  and they were like  \u201cali  why are you gonna have a kid  you just gonna become\u2013 you\u2019re gonna disappear  and you\u2019re gonna become some lame stay at home mom \u201d i was like  \u201cyeah  that\u2019s the dream \u201d that\u2019s the point  this is the ultimate trap  i won  you know \nanother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid  they were like  \u201cwhy are you gonna have a kid  why don\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached \u201d i was like  \u201cyeah  that\u2019s cool\u2026 until my husband dies \u201d which he\u2019s definitely gonna before me  because i\u2019m a asian woman  and therefore  guaranteed to live until i\u2019m a billion  i\u2019m guaranteed  like a turtle from the galapagos  ok  we all know the phrase \u201cblack don\u2019t crack \u201d well  asian don\u2019t die  we don\u2019t die  especially the women  we live forever  and you know why we\u2019re such bad drivers  because we\u2019re trying to die  we\u2019re like  \u201cyeah  let me see how invincible i really am \u201d \u201cimma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely \u201d \u201ci\u2019m gonna make a right turn\u2013 i changed my mind  it\u2019s a u turn \u201d \u201ci changed my mind again  it\u2019s a o turn \u201d every time i get into a car accident\u2026 \u2026i\u2019m like  \u201coh  my god  not again \u201d i need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be  so embarrassing  my toyota corolla is a mess  there\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere  and then  on the hood  there\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence  i don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me  but i\u2019m still here  you know  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older  it\u2019s lonely  my mom is    going through a full blown mid life crisis  \u2018cause she knows that she\u2019s got a century more to go  and she is so lonely  all of her white friends  dead  her mexican friends  dead  black friends  dead  i\u2019m just kidding  she doesn\u2019t have any black friends  life is not rush hour  the movie  ok  i need children to be there for me when i\u2019m older  when i get as old as her  and when i say be there for me  i mean pay for me when my husband isn\u2019t around to support me anymore  i\u2019m not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living  that\u2019s not my destiny  ok  old chinese ladies  they don\u2019t give a fuck  they got no shame  they\u2019re like  \u201ci\u2019m just gonna recycle\u2026 go bald\u2026 go to the park  do this shit \u201d they do that \u2019cause it\u2019s a free activity  for them  they do it in their\u2013 their big ass v  stiviano visor  their darth vader tomb raider  boba fett helmet  they wear that to protect themselves from their arch nemesis  the sun  their in a contest to see who\u2019s gonna burn out first  old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity  i also decided to have a kid because uh  i\u2019m only    which  i know  is not technically high risk  but my body was starting to show signs of change  and it\u2013 and it scared me  like  i\u2019m only   and\u2026 \u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be  it\u2019s very demoralizing  ok  do you remember when you were   years old  and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time  all the time  you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment  you throw up the peace sign afterwards  and there would be that snail trail in between your fingers  oh  my god  it was so juicy  you could just blow a bubble wand with it  just\u2026 \u201ci slime you  i slime you  ghostbusters \u201d i don\u2019t know what kind of mother i\u2019m gonna be  i\u2019m\u2013 i\u2019m    and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant  and a lot of that\u2026 is most likely my fault  because  when i was in my    i ate plan b like skittles  so  my uterus probably looked like a smoker\u2019s lung  and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low  so  then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories  and push pop them up myself every single night  and then  at my writing job  at fresh off the boat  i would be storyboarding in front of my co workers  and then  at some point  the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear  and i had to act like everything was ok  when everything was clearly not ok  and then  a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy  so  then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table  and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards  i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers  housewives  they can just scratch and sniff all day long  they just vacuum  scratch  sniff  they make a sandwich  \u201cuh  mmm \u201d they watch property brothers  scratch  \u201cwhat\u2019s crackin\u2019  mmm \u201d every time you scratch yourself  all you can think about is  \u201cwhen can i smell my fingers  when can i smell my fingers  when can i discretely find a way to\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026smell my fingers \u201d nature made you urgently curious to protect you  \u2019cause you gotta check that it\u2019s all good in the hood  if it\u2019s too funky  you need to see a doctor  your fingers are your first webmd  when my husband and i were trying to have a kid  a lot of people were like  \u201coh  my god  that\u2019s so hot  you guys doin\u2019 a lot of fuckin\u2019 \u201d no  dude  that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s shit you do in your    ok  when in\u2013 when you\u2019re in your    and you\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while  it gets very clinical  you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\u2019  it tells you when it\u2019s easter time  and i would only fuck him when it was easter time  it was  like  only four days out of the month  and outside of that  i would be like  \u201cwe\u2019re not fuckin\u2019  i need you to save it  i want your sperm to be as pent up  and as angry and rapey as possible  so that  when they come out  it\u2019s like  \u2018release the kraken  \u201d and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  you know  and  um\u2026 yeah  and most of the time  like  we wouldn\u2019t even have sex  \u2019cause i was so tired when i would come home  and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip  and i\u2019d be like  \u201cok  it\u2019s go time \u201d and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time  and he would close his eyes immediately  i know what that means  ok  when somebody closes their eyes during sex  it\u2019s not because they\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\u2013 that they need to close their eyes  when somebody closes their eyes during sex  it\u2019s because they\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids  which is fine by me  because then he doesn\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says  \u201cplease  hurry the fuck up \u201d and then  when he was about to finish  i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish  it\u2019s when they get that\u2026 that stupid ass look on their face\u2026 \u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie  just\u2026 and then  because we\u2019re hippies  i\u2019d be like  \u201chey  hey  please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention  ok \u201d and then  i would jump on him  and hold onto his neck  and i would just twerk  twerk  twerk the shit out of him\u2026 and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta  and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards\u2026 to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me  that\u2019s right  \u2018cause i don\u2019t wanna work anymore  i\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\u2026 this far along  to be seven and a half months pregnant  because  last year  i had a miscarriage  which is very common  and a lot of women who are in their   flip out when they hear that  they\u2019re like  \u201coh  my god  that\u2019s so dark and terrible  i can\u2019t believe that \u201d i\u2019m    girl  when you\u2019re    you\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage  it\u2019s super common  and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it  when i told my mom\u2013 she\u2019s from a third world country  and when i told her i had one  she was like  \u201cuh  yeah  where i\u2019m from  that\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes  it\u2019s whatevs  ok \u201d and everything happens for a reason  i found out at my six week sonogram  which is very early  and the doctor says to me  \u201coh  my god  i see two sacks  which means you\u2019re having twins \u201d and i was like  \u201cno \u201d and then she said  \u201cbut what i don\u2019t see is a heartbeat \u201d and i was like  \u201cyes \u201d \u201cthe lord is mysterious \u201d don\u2019t feel bad  ok  they were the size of poppy seeds  i\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost  and most women won\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\u2019re going through a miscarriage  i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet  and i was like  \u201cyou look \u201d \u201cyou watch the whole thing \u201d and he felt so bad for me  and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for   days  he took me to see beyonc\u00e9  he bought me a bike off of craigslist  that\u2019s my miscarriage bike  and i love it very much  for   days  i finally had the marriage i always wanted  i\u2019m scared about giving childbirth  though  i\u2019m\u2013 i\u2019m very  very scared of childbirth  that\u2019s why i\u2019m going to hire a doula  you know what that is  you know what a doula is  that\u2019s a white hippie witch\u2026 \u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\u00f6ze all the pain away  a lot of women tried to freak me out  they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying  \u201cali  did you know that you\u2019re gonna poop on the table \u201d i was like  \u201cyeah  i look forward to it \u201d i\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work  i can\u2019t wait to cleanse  it makes sense  like  that you\u2013 that that happens because when you\u2019re in labor  you push  you push  you push  and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg  which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever  you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life  and just when you think that\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you  boom  a baby comes out  and he gotta stay  that\u2019s the real miracle of life  right there  i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage  because the baby hasn\u2019t even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband  so much resentment  especially when he asks me to do shit around the house  \u201chey  can you wash the dishes \u201d \u201cno \u201d \u201ccan you water the plants \u201d \u201ci am not doing jack shit anymore  i\u2019m busy makin\u2019 a eyeball  ok  are you makin\u2019 a foot  i didn\u2019t think so  you change the channel \u201d i can already see how there\u2019s  like  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad  and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom  people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\u2019s appointments with me  \u201coh  my god  i can\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\u2019s appointments  he is so supportive \u201d guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments  me  i\u2019m the star of the show  there\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if i\u2019m not there  but he\u2019s the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn  meanwhile  if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant  i\u2019m a bad mommy  you know  i\u2013 i\u2013 i  like  i berate my husband on  like  a daily basis  partially because i really am mad at him  but mostly out of survival  because if he leaves me  i\u2019m fucked  so  i have to chip away at his self esteem on a daily basis\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s worthy of another woman\u2019s affection and leaves me  i gotta keep him around by keeping him down  people don\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  you know  your nipples get huge and dark  i didn\u2019t know that  i didn\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see  like  a bullseye  so that the baby can find it easier  and then  you know  they get big\u2013 they get big  like fingers  like  \u201cyou  you  you owe me money  you \u201d my nipples look like whoppers now  and naked  i look like a minion  but i\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant  no  hopefully  if you see me in a year  i will have the kind of body where  if i do a nude scene on television  people will commend me for being courageous  for doing it  now that i\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant  my pussy\u2019s all wet again  but it\u2019s different  it\u2019s not like when i was   years old  when it was like  really hot  you know  and i was like  \u201cwhy is it different \u201d and i looked it up  and my pussy\u2019s all wet again because my\u2013 my body\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it  that\u2019s not the same  when it\u2019s straight up soldier glue  when it\u2019s neosporin  so  you know  i\u2013 i  in\u2013 previously  before i met my husband  i had dated a bunch of losers  and then  i meet this dream guy  who\u2019s  like  way more handsome than me  out of my league  graduated from harvard business school  worked hard to trap his ass  got him to propose to me  oh  my god  then we got married  all my dreams coming true  and then we got pregnant  and recently we bought our first home together  and  uh  two weeks into the escrow process  i discovered that my beautiful  harvard educated husband was      in debt  and me  with my hard earned tv money  paid it all off  so  as it turns out  he\u2019s the one who trapped me  how did he do it  how did he bamboozle me  oh  maybe because he went to harvard business school  the epicenter of white collar crime  he enron\u2019d my ass  and now  if i don\u2019t work  we die  why else do you think i\u2019m performing seven and a half months

time  he was someone that you would look up to and want approval of  at the time  at the time  it was someone you wanted to be nice to you  um  anyway  so he was hosting  and i i was just thrilled  so  uh  i smoked a joint  uh  in my dressing room  and as i was leaving to go into the elevators  um\u2026 louis c k  was  like  holding court and talking to  like  a bunch of the cast and writers and  like  cool people  and  like  they were  like  clearly very into a conversation  so i was just  like  \u201ci don\u2019t want any part of that \u201d like  you know  i\u2019m high  i don\u2019t wanna  like  ruin it for anybody  or  like  i don\u2019t want that guy to know i exist  you know  so i just put my hoodie on  and i closed it really tight  and i walked all the way around to the other side of the elevators so i could not  you know  be in the way at all  and  uh  so i press the button  and i\u2019m just waitin\u2019 there  and then all of a sudden  louis c k  stops his conversation  he looks up and points at me and goes  \u201clook how fuckin\u2019 high pete is  that fuckin\u2019 idiot  just getting fuckin\u2019 high at work  you stupid fuck  you\u2019re gonna smoke your career away  idiot \u201d \u2013 oh  my god  and i was  like  so high  i was like  \u201cthat didn\u2019t happen \u201d  i was like  \u201cno  no  no  nah \u201d this is a me issue  for sure  he probably said  \u201csee you tomorrow  champ \u201d  you know  i probably\u2026 so i go to work the next day  and i get a phone call from lorne michaels\u2019 office  uh  this was alarming because i\u2019ve been there for a year  and i have yet to hear from his office until today  so i was like  \u201coh  shit \u201d you know  so i answered the phone  and they\u2019re like  \u201chey  louis just left lorne\u2019s office  he went in there to talk about you  and now lorne wants to\u2013 you\u2013 to talk to you now \u201d and i was like  \u201coh  fuck  all right \u201d you know  \u2019cause i was like  \u201cnow i\u2019m gettin\u2019 fired \u201d like  this is what i thought  so i was just trying to hype myself up  it\u2019s like i was just like  you know  uh  \u201cfuck them  they\u2019re the ones who look stupid anyway  they hired and fired you  they\u2019re wrong twice \u201d  you know  fuckin\u2019\u2026 yeah  i was like  \u201cyou could creep into the back and wild out  and nobody would fuckin\u2019 notice   who gives a shit  right \u201d um\u2026 so\u2026 i was walking  uh  into his office  just trying to feel better and whatever  and i open the door  and lorne\u2019s sitting there  right  and he  uh  looks really confused  uh  as do i \u2019cause  you know  that\u2019s just  like  how i look  you know  i look like  you know  you just asked me to  like  divide  \u2013 uh\u2026 i don\u2019t know  um\u2026 anyway  so he looks very confused  and he\u2019s like  \u201csit down \u201d so i do  and he goes  \u201cso\u2026 uh\u2026 um  louis  uh  came in and told me that  uh  you smoke weed \u201d uh  and i was like  \u201cuh  yes  uh\u2026 the rumors that you have heard ring true \u201d and then i saw  with his eyes  he kinda looked deflated  like he didn\u2019t know what to say  you know  \u2018cause with his eyes  he\u2019s like  \u201ci\u2019m sorry we\u2019re having this conversation  but  like  louis told on you  and he told me to talk to you  and  personally  i don\u2019t think this is a big deal \u2019cause people used to do coke here  and i think you\u2019re a pussy  actually  i\u2019m really sorry we\u2019re having this conversation \u201d you know  and i read that with his eyes  and with my eyes  i said  \u201cno doubt  homie \u201d so\u2026 you know  it was just  like  awkward for another second  and it was quiet  and then he goes  \u201cyeah  so i guess  uh  you know  what you could do is  i guess  you know  \u2019cause i\u2013 he said you smoke a lot of weed  so maybe you could just  like  watch  uh  the amount of weed that you smoke \u201d and i was like  \u201call right  i\u2019ll watch \u201d i was like  \u201ci\u2019ll never leave it out of my sight \u201d i was like  \u201cno problem  i\u2019m a man of my word \u201d and i was like\u2026 uh  he goes  \u201cyeah \u201d he goes  \u201cum  again  i\u2019m sorry to have this conversation with you  but louis brought it to my attention and said  you know  you\u2019re smokin\u2019  uh  your career away  and you smoked so much weed in the office the other day that it actually made him uncomfortable \u201d and i was like  \u201coh  shit  like  really \u201d and he\u2019s like  \u201cyeah \u201d and i was like  \u201coh  so  like  am i fired \u201d and he was like  \u201cno \u201d and i was like  \u201cwhy \u201d and he was like  \u201ci don\u2019t know \u201d  uh\u2026 which  again  is a conversation we have yearly  on a yearly basis  \u201cis this the year \u201d \u201ci don\u2019t know  not yet  i don\u2019t know  we\u2019ll figure\u2013 we\u2019ll figure it out  i don\u2019t know \u201d and that fucking killed me  you know  like  i had to leave that office  like  with that  you know  just like  louis c k  doesn\u2019t like you  you know  one of the best comedians arguably ever  you know  and especially at the time  like  one of\u2026 it just killed me  you know  \u2019cause  like  why am i even doing stand up if this guy doesn\u2019t like me  you know  that\u2019s somebody\u2019s approval you want  and i was like  \u201cthis guy fucking doesn\u2019t like me \u2019cause i smoke weed \u201d that\u2013 that sucks  you know  and i had to  like  sit with that for  like  five years  you know   and then  one glorious morning\u2026 \u2026i woke up  and i read  \u201clouis c k  jerks off in front of women \u201d and i went  \u201cyes \u201d i\u2019m\u2026 you know what i mean  like  i didn\u2019t want it to happen  but if it was gonna happen to anybody  i\u2019m glad it was him  you know  does that make sense  okay  nah  it\u2019s just\u2026 let me just tell you how crazy it is to jerk off alone  okay  um\u2026 yeah  just  you know  be in the room with me  you know   is it okay  \u2013 yeah   um\u2026 so\u2026 just  you know  jerking off alone is fuckin\u2019 weird  you ever  like  jerk off  and it\u2013 it\u2019s taking a long time  and you can\u2019t even make yourself come  and you\u2019re like  \u201cyou\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 loser  like  you can\u2019t\u2026 can\u2019t even do yourself  oof  what makes you think anybody else would wanna do you \u201d you know  there\u2019s that old tale  you catch yourself in the mirror  that\u2019s happened to me  actually  \u2019cause i\u2019m stupid  not any\u2013 never again \u2019cause now i jerk off in the pitch black  yeah  i do  phone facedown  you know  \u2019cause you could get a text  and it could reflect off the mirror  and then you can catch yourself in the corner jerking off  mom text at the top  you ever try to jerk off after getting a mom text  it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s damn near impossible  i didn\u2019t say \u201cimpossible \u201d but it is damn near  for sure  it is one of the harder things i\u2019ve had to do  but  no  it just\u2013 it bummed me out  like  hearin\u2019 all this shit \u2019cause  like  i just felt bad for all those women that he jerked off in front of  it\u2019s just really sad  you know  \u2019cause it really affected them  and  like  if they only knew that  like  you know  when louis  like  whipped out his dick and started jerkin\u2019 it  if they just  like  lit up a blunt  he would\u2019ve been like  \u201coh  fuck  is that weed  holy shit  you fuckin\u2019 animals  i\u2019m telling  you pieces of shit  oh  fuck  you\u2019re gonna smoke away your career \u201d my friend  uh  that i financially support  uh  had a kid  so  uh  i\u2019m a dad  yeah  i wasn\u2019t exactly ready for it  uh\u2026 he gave me a call  he was all excited  he was like  \u201cyo  bro  i got great news \u201d i was like  \u201cyou got a job \u201d and he was like  \u201cno  bro  i had a kid \u201d and i was like  \u201cwow  that\u2019s  like  the exact opposite of a job \u201d i can\u2019t wait to have a kid  i\u2019m very excited  i don\u2019t think it\u2019s very hard at all  no  \u2019cause all my friends are havin\u2019 \u2019em  and their complaints  uh  they don\u2019t  uh  bother me very much  all their complaints are the same  they\u2019re like  \u201cbro  it cries \u201d and i\u2019m like  \u201coh  man  go in the other room \u201d yeah  everything cries  you know  you try to make it stop  and then you leave  i cry all the time  eventually  my friends are like  \u201cyo  dude  i gotta go to work  i don\u2019t know  fuckin\u2019 figure it out  get offline \u201d so that  they say it cries  uh  and the other complaint is  they\u2019re like  \u201cyo  it  like  shits all the time \u201d and that doesn\u2019t really bother me either  because  like  you know  so do i  you know  so i don\u2019t mind cleaning it up at  like  a smaller scale  you know  plus  when you clean kids  sometimes you see spots that  like  you might have missed on yourself  you know  yeah  you know  you\u2019re like  \u201cwow  i\u2019ve never seen my asshole from this angle before \u201d you\u2019re like  \u201ci will dab that corner when i hop out the shower \u201d you hop out the shower  you\u2019re like   \u201cson of a bitch \u201d i love babysitting\u2026 uh  \u2019cause i microdose mushrooms  so i speak baby   uh\u2026 yeah  i love it  they\u2019re talking  you know  uh  the other day  my  uh  my nephew was like  \u201cbleh \u201d and i was like  \u201cforensic files  got it \u201d so  i was\u2026 mushrooms are great  mushrooms are like\u2026 are kinda like being on a roller coaster when you\u2019re  like  going up  but  like  you just never go down  it\u2019s just the way up  you know  where you\u2019re like  \u201cthis is sick  this is awesome  i can\u2019t believe we\u2019re doin\u2019 this  oh  my god \u201d for like four hours  something weird  uh  happened when i was babysitting  uh  the other day  uh  my friend  uh  his son i is still teething  right  and  uh  so  like  we were watchin\u2019 forensic files  and i was just sittin\u2019 there  and  uh  h he\u2019s teething  so he just  like  grabbed my hand and started  like  sucking my fingers  but  like  good  \u2013like\u2026 like  i definitely left it in there for a second  i was like  \u201cno  wow  but no \u201d i know that joke splits the room   uh\u2026 i\u2019m aware  it\u2019s not the first time i\u2019ve done this  uh\u2026 i know it\u2019s weird to tell jokes like that  but this is a joke  you know  this is a comedy club  you know  it would be weird if this was  like  a town hall meeting  and i  like  grab the mic  and i was like  \u201chey  guys  here are some ideas i have \u201d \u201call right  i\u2019ll be in the lot with buttons \u201d um\u2026 i think girls should tell guys how to make them come  uh\u2026 like  the first time you have sex  before  like  have a debriefing  you know  you know  \u2019cause apparently every girl is different is  uh  you know  what i\u2019m telling myself  everyone is different  and i think one of them is just dead inside   um\u2026 yeah  i think\u2013 i\u2019m like  \u201cno  i think you\u2019re just broken \u201d  uh\u2026 no  no  yeah  yeah  sorry  i don\u2019t know  sometimes  you just say giggly things  um  no  but yeah  girls should tell guys  uh  how to make them come  not when they\u2019re comfortable  you know  i know you don\u2019t want to hurt the guy\u2019s feelings  but it won\u2019t  uh  it doesn\u2019t  you know  you could be\u2013 we could be mid   you know  fuck  and you could be like  \u201ci hate this \u201d and we\u2019ll be like  \u201coh  how\u2019s this  good  okay  forgotten \u201d you know  didn\u2019t even happen  you know  you should just tell the guy  you know  like  i guess guy stuff is very self explanatory  right  you just  like  yank it  and shit flies out  right  it\u2019s really easy  like  my son could do it  and  uh\u2026  aw  but yeah  apparently  you know  it\u2019s not very hard to make girls come  you know  like  if you\u2019re sweating and out of breath  i\u2019m told you have done it wrong  but  you know  all i know is from  like  porn because i grew up with just  like  a mom and a sister  right  so  like  we never had that talk  you know  i just never had that dinner where i felt comfortable to be like  you know  \u201cyo  guys  if i wasn\u2019t your son or brother  uh\u2026\u201d you know  so  uh  everything i knew  uh  was from porn  which is  like  a lot of movement and  like  screaming and  uh\u2026 you know  sometimes you just take it out and do a couple push ups  you know  and then go right\u2026 um  sorry  you know  so i i didn\u2019t really\u2013 i didn\u2019t really know  but  like  luckily  uh  one  uh  lady told me  apparently  there\u2019s just  like\u2026 there\u2019s this little\u2026 uh  this little thing in the vagina  it\u2019s  like  a little circle thing  i it kinda\u2026 you know boxing  it kinda looks like the thing that\u2019s like this  the  like  speed bag thing  the thing that guys go slow or quite fast on  and apparently  the vagina is  uh  quite the same  you know  you know  you just kinda just tap that little thing very  very lightly\u2026 uh  or\u2013 or floor it  uh  apparently  those are the two options  yeah  don\u2019t even have to change your outfit  uh\u2026 but  yeah  you should just tell the guy  you know  like i said  guy stuff is very self explanatory  but if someone ever pulled my pants down and just started  like  punching my dick  i wouldn\u2019t be like  \u201caw  fuck  i hope she figures it out   ow  ow  ow  ow  ow  ow  this is war \u201d i would be like  \u201cwho sent you  what is this  is this\u2026 is this an assassination attempt \u201d like  here\u2019s something  uh  that no guy likes  but we\u2019re  like  afraid  uh  to tell  uh  the girl  you know  because  uh  we\u2019re  like  so close to\u2026 b banging\u2026 there\u2019s not many words  uh  t to say what that is  so \u201cbanging\u201d is  you know  the most appropriate\u2026 for\u2026 and this is gonna be on nickelodeon   yeah  you know  yeah  that\u2019s why i wore a suit  you know  \u2018cause usually  i don\u2019t  i always just usually dress like i\u2019m ready to be slimed   uh  but\u2026 but i found a nice lady suit at the banana republic  and i\u2019m fucking crushing it right now  i look like a divorced wife who just  like  got it together  \u201cdon\u2019t come back  i have a repertoire now \u201d um\u2026 but  yeah  here\u2019s something that\u2013 that no\u2013 no guy likes  uh  at all  uh  you know when  like  a girl\u2019s on top  right  before they  like  shove the dick in them  again  i know that\u2019s not the best way to say it  but believe it or not  i\u2019ve tried five other ways  and \u201cshove the dick in them\u201d won by  like  a landslide   i it\u2026 so just imagine how horrible the other four were  right   suddenly it\u2019s better  um\u2026 so  yeah  you know when they\u2019re on top  and they\u2019re about to slam it up there   uh\u2026 see  yeah  yeah  that\u2019s what i was sayin\u2019  so you know when you\u2019re on top  and you\u2019re about to shove the dick in ya  uh\u2026 some\u2013 some girls  most  uh  usually they just start sliding  uh  o on top of the dicks before they put it up there  they\u2019re just like  \u201cyeah  yeah  do you like this \u201d no  we don\u2019t  fuckin\u2019 hurts  a lot  stop doing that  every girl ever  please  please  just put it in there  please  it hurts so fucking bad  it hurts  you know  \u2019cause you shave or you don\u2019t  either way  you\u2019re all prickly down there  right  and then you just start  like  rubbing that against our bare little dicks  that shit hurts  you\u2019re like  \u201cooh  you like that \u201d we\u2019re like  \u201cno  have you ever gotten an indian burn  \u2018cause that\u2019s what it feels like  feels like you\u2019re my mom\u2019s weird friend that would do that  when she wasn\u2019t around \u201d yeah  everybody remembers that weird friend  right  everybody\u2019d go upstairs  and he\u2019d be like  \u201chey  kid

i\u2019m enjoying that with you \u2019cause it\u2019s the first time i also heard it  um\u2026 so  you know  i i go on the floor  right  and my buddy told me he might\u2019ve lost his eye in a war  so right now  i\u2019m like  \u201caw  fuck  i got to be mindful of that  right \u201d i got to apologize after the joke i say  right  get\u2013 get ahead of it  right  so i i slide out  right  and i do

and people were like  \u201cyou hate america \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cno  i just didn\u2019t want to be incorrect about how he lost his fuckin\u2019 eye \u201d is that a fucking crime  he could\u2019ve lost his eye in war or whatever  i don\u2019t know how he lost his eye  could\u2019ve been in afghanistan  could\u2019ve been making a sandwich  i have no fuckin\u2019 idea  sorry i don\u2019t have fuckin\u2019 dan crenshaw fuckin\u2019 baseball cards with all of his stats and information  my bad  it\u2019s an expression  i was trying to be mindful  you know  general patton  right  general patton  one of america\u2019s greatest heroes  he died in nazi germany a week after the war in a car accident  right  but when we talk about the great general patton  we say  \u201cyou know  he died in war or whatever \u201d you know  it\u2019s just easier to say rather than  like  \u201cwell  he won the war  and then made a bad turn  and\u2026\u201d yeah  it\u2019s an expression  doesn\u2019t mean i hate america  okay  so  the only thing i i i i don\u2019t like is people  like  \u201cit\u2019s your fault that guy won \u201d and that\u2019s not true  i think  like  most of the votes were in  and that guy is a republican with an eye patch in texas  uh  so it was a lock before it even started  yeah  i could\u2019ve told you that  they just  in texas  i\u2019m pretty sure they just only have pictures  that\u2019s how they vote  you know  so i i did not make that guy win  okay  that is  you know  america\u2019s fault  you know  as is this  uh\u2026 yeah  you know  i did not\u2013 i did not do anything for that guy  the only thing i did do  which i am guilty of  and i apologize for  is i did make that guy famous and a household name for no reason  right  i did what  like  ariana grande did for me  right  yeah  yes  \u201ci sucked his dick at snl \u201d uh\u2026 i wasn\u2019t gonna do jokes about this  but then my buddy told me  he\u2019s like  \u201cyo  i\u2019ve recently heard that ariana said she had no idea who you were  and she just dated you as a distraction \u201d so now i just think it\u2019s  like  fair game  uh\u2026 so  yeah  also  don\u2019t applaud  this isn\u2019t  like  a drake vs  lil wayne concert  like  this isn\u2019t  like  a competition  you know  she has  you know  her songs and stuff  and this is what i have  okay  so\u2026 all right

and then fortnite came out \u201d it would be insane  and you\u2019re like  \u201cpete  something had to happen to her  right  there had to be some repercussions  right \u201d no  she won billboard\u2019s woman of the year  and i got called \u201cbutthole eyes\u201d by barstoolsports com  so sometimes  life is a little unfair  again  these are jokes  i i don\u2019t want any smoke  okay

i should say that \u2019cause it will just stop the show and make things awkward  i won  i was right  when your dad dies  and he works for  like  the state or the government or whatever\u2026 i don\u2019t know  he was a fireman  whatever that is  um\u2026 you  uh\u2026 sometimes your family gets  like  a little bit of money  not a lot of money  a little bit  so\u2026 um  we got a little bit of money  and i remember my mom  you know  to make me and my sister feel better  uh  she wan wanted to get us a pool with the money  right  uh  she figured she\u2019d get us a pool  and then  you know  like  people would want to be our friends  and they would come over and swim in it  you know  which is dark  um\u2026 swim in the death pool  uh\u2026 yeah  like  it\u2019s a nice idea  but the sentiment  every cannon ball has a weird meaning behind it  just doing laps every day like  \u201cis this even  is this even \u201d no  uh\u2026 no  i remember my mom got us a pool  me and my sister  right  and  uh  kids\u2013 i was  like  seven when my dad died  so  like  kids don\u2019t understand that shit  they don\u2019t\u2013 they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on  right  so i remember i got the pool  and kids at school would be like  \u201cyo  you\u2019re so lucky  man  you\u2019re rich  you have a pool \u201d you know  and i\u2019d be like  \u201cyeah  luckily  i have a pool  that i fill up with tears every summer  \u2018cause that\u2019s how you know you\u2019re rich  when you can swim in your own sadness  thank god osama bin laden didn\u2019t miss his alarm clock  you know why  i wouldn\u2019t have a fucking pool  i\u2019m sorry  please come over later  i appreciate it \u201d we\u2019re keeping that  jason  i don\u2019t care what you say  anyway  so i did this  uh  thing about my dad over the summer  i had to  like  shoot this thing  so i had to  like  do  like  research on my dad kinda  and i had to  like  hang out with his friends  right  and i\u2019m from staten island  my dad\u2019s from staten island  so  you know  his friends are like me  they\u2013 they\u2019re trash  right  yeah  we\u2019re garbage people  literally  we have\u2013 we\u2013 we\u2019re known  like  the thing\u2013 we\u2019re known for having the world\u2019s biggest garbage dump  uh  that you can see from space  that\u2019s what the cab driver would say as you entered staten island  \u201ci don\u2019t know if you knew this  but this place has the biggest dump \u201d you know  as opposed to like  \u201clook at the tree \u201d um\u2026 and you\u2019re like  \u201caw  well  what happened to the dump \u201d you know  \u201cwhat\u2019d they do \u201d ah  well  they built a park over it  uh  and you\u2019re like  \u201coh  that\u2013 you mean  they\u2013 they got rid of all the garbage \u201d no  they just fuckin\u2019 built a fucking park over it  so  in ten years  when it starts fallin\u2019 apart  kids are just getting stabbed by fuckin\u2019 \u2019  hondas  anyway  i\u2019m trying to explain to you staten island people  it\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s not a good exam\u2013 oh  it\u2019s kinda like\u2014 like  if you had a marlboro red  and you  like  threw it in the bathtub  and it  like  came to life  that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 \u2026that\u2019s what a staten island guy is like  you know  um\u2026 anyway  so i had to go meet up with his friends  right  but  uh  all the stories i knew from my dad were from when i was seven  you know  so the stories that they were telling me were  like  way different\u2026 than what i had previously heard  uh\u2026 like  i don\u2019t even know who this guy is  uh  like  i\u2019ll give you an example  when i was little  my dad\u2019s friends would be like  \u201cyour dad was the man  you know  we used to  like  play basketball and do our homework  you know  he always used to finish his plate  always used to finish his plate  finish it \u201d why  i figured out\u2026 \u2026there\u2019s a reason why finishing your plate at seven was so difficult  it\u2019s \u2019cause adults are saving us the same size portion as them  and we\u2019re a third of their size  so when we get a third of the way through  we are full  and you yelling  \u201ceat it \u201d doesn\u2019t help  it just makes everybody fat  you know what i mean  my mom used to be like  \u201cthere\u2019s starving kids in africa \u201d that was her go to line to guilt me into anything  i\u2019d be like  \u201cyeah  be that may  but if a kid in africa got a third of the way through this  he\u2019d be like  \u2013 \u2018i am full  \u201d i like how half of you are like  \u201cthat\u2019s funny \u201d and the other half are like  \u201ci don\u2019t know if you can do that  dude \u201d i guess we\u2019ll check twitter  the decider of all  twitter\u2019s the new pearly gates  they decide all people\u2019s futures  um  anyway  so i had to meet with my dad  uh  his friends  and i was like  \u201ctell me some stories about my dad \u201d and he was like  \u201coh  we used to do coke all the time \u201d \u2013 and i was like  \u201cwhat \u201d and he was like  \u201coh  i\u2019m sorry  was i not supposed to tell you \u201d and i was like  \u201cno  it\u2019s cool  it\u2019s just  i wasn\u2019t expecting that  you know  growing up  i heard  like  you know  he always played basketball and did his homework and  like  finished his plate  you know  i guess the third one still applies kinda  but\u2026 yeah   um\u2026 i just wasn\u2019t\u2013\u201d and he\u2019s like  \u201ci\u2019m sorry  should i like protect you  am i  like

fuckin\u2019 superhero  i didn\u2019t know he was the coolest guy ever \u201d what a man of the \u2019   just doing blow and putting out fires  what a legend  never been prouder  god  did that make me

don\u2019t be coming out doing comedy all the time  \u2019cause y\u2019all n i g g a s is the worst motherfuckers i\u2019ve ever tried to entertain in my fucking life  ugh  i\u2019m goddamn sick of it  this is the worst time ever to be a celebrity  you\u2019re gonna be finished  everyone\u2019s doomed  michael jackson has been dead for ten years and this n i g g a has two new cases  and if you haven\u2019t watched that documentary\u2026 uh  then i\u2019m begging you  don\u2019t watch it  it\u2019s fucking gross  i felt like hbo was sticking baby dicks in my ears for four hours straight  really nasty shit  i don\u2019t want to know all these things  turns out  uh  michael jackson allegedly likes a long gander at the anus  they said he stares at people\u2019s buttholes  that\u2019s what they said  that\u2019s how gross the documentary was  i\u2019m gonna say something that i\u2019m not allowed to say  but i gotta be real  uh\u2026 i don\u2019t believe these motherfuckers  i do not believe them  but\u2026 let me qualify the statement  i\u2026 i am what\u2019s known on the streets as a victim blamer  you know what i mean  if somebody come up to me like  \u201cdave  dave  chris brown just beat up rihanna \u201d i\u2019ll be like  \u201cwell  what did she do \u201d \u201cdave  michael jackson was molesting children \u201d \u201cwell  what were those kids wearing at the time \u201d i don\u2019t think he did it  but you know what  even if he did do it\u2026 you know what i mean  you know what i mean  eh\u2026 i mean  it\u2019s michael jackson  i know more than half the people in this room have been molested in their lives  but it wasn\u2019t no goddamn michael jackson  was it  this kid got his dick sucked by the king of pop  all we get is awkward thanksgivings for the rest of our lives  you know how good it must\u2019ve felt to go to school the next day after that shit  \u201chey  billy  how was the weekend \u201d \u201chow was my weekend  michael jackson sucked my dick  and that was my first sexual experience  if i\u2019m starting here  then sky\u2019s the limit \u201d i know it seems harsh  but  man  somebody\u2019s gotta teach these kids  there\u2019s no such thing as a free trip to hawaii  he\u2019s gonna want to look at your butthole or something  you know why i don\u2019t believe it  you know why i don\u2019t believe it  because if michael jackson\u2019s out here doing all this molesting  then\u2013 then why not macaulay culkin  hmm  macaulay culkin stated in an interview that michael jackson never did anything inappropriate with him or even around him  think about that shit  you know\u2026 i\u2019m not a pedophile  but if i was\u2026 macaulay culkin\u2019s the first kid i\u2019m fucking  i\u2019ll tell you that right now  i\u2019d be a goddamn hero  \u201chey  that guy over there fucked the kid from home alone  and you know how hard he is to catch \u201d \u266a my mind\u2019s telling me  \u201cno\u201d \u266a \u2013

that shit  you know  it was bad  okay  so a couple years ago  i was doing a show in detroit  and i\u2019m sitting backstage in my dressing room and a friend of mine comes by  this chick  dream hampton  dream  uh  tells me  right before i\u2019m going on stage  she goes  \u201cdave  i\u2019m working on a documentary about r  kelly  \u201cwould you like to be in it \u201d and i was like  \u201cnah

shit and she keeps bringing me up  she said  \u201ci asked dave chappelle to be in my documentary  and he said it was too hot for tv \u201d bitch  i did not say that  that does not even sound like how i talk  \u201coh  that\u2019s too hot for tv \u201d i would never say that shit  but i\u2019m gonna tell you guys why i wasn\u2019t in the documentary  it\u2019s a very simple reason  and  uh  i cannot stress this point enough  the only reason that i didn\u2019t do it was because  and this is very important\u2026 i don\u2019t know this n i g g a at all  i don\u2019t know anything  i don\u2019t know anything that they don\u2019t tell me about  i don\u2019t hang out with this n i g g a  nothing  so what the fuck do i got to be in the documentary for  this guy  r  kelly  got another sex tape out now  can you believe that shit  this guy makes more sex tapes than he does music  he\u2019s like the dj khaled of sex tapes  \u201canother one \u201d like  damn  n i g g a  that\u2019s a lot of tapes  the new one\u2019s so bad that they didn\u2019t even show it  i\u2019ve never seen anything like this  the prosecutor in chicago came out in a press conference and read to the media a transcript of a sex tape  have you ever heard of such a thing  this n i g g a read the sex tape  and it was so bad that r  kelly sounded guilty in the transcripts  it\u2019s fucking amazing  sixteen times the girl\u2019s age was mentioned  isn\u2019t that crazy  this motherfucker is an idiot  he was fuckin\u2019 her like  \u201cyeah  this is the best   year old pussy i\u2019ve ever had in my life \u201d she was like  \u201cyou like this   year old pussy \u201d like  \u201coh  yeah  i love this \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cman  you need to shut the fuck up \u201d you gotta give your lawyer something to work with  you supposed to be on the tape like  \u201cthis is the best\u2026   year old pussy i\u2019ve ever had in my life \u201d then your lawyer can be like  \u201cyour honor  clearly my client thought that this woman was    as he mentioned some   times in the tape \u201d they gonna know you lying  though  you know what i mean  everybody knows\u2026 no such thing as good   year old pussy  doesn\u2019t matter what i say  and if you at home watching this shit on netflix  remember  bitch  you clicked on my face  celebrity hunting season  doesn\u2019t matter what i say  they\u2019re going to get everybody eventually  like  look  i don\u2019t think i did anything wrong  but\u2026 but we\u2019ll see  they even got poor kevin hart  can you imagine such a thing  kevin hart  let me tell you something  it was\u2026 it was kevin hart\u2019s dream to host the oscars  that\u2019s what he told me  and i remember when he told me  \u2019cause i was thinking to myself  \u201cwell  that\u2019s an awfully strange dream for an african american \u201d what kind of n i g g a dreams of hosting the oscars  kevin did  that\u2019s who  and he did it  against all the odds  kevin became the most famous comedian this world has ever seen  and he got the job that only one black man before him had had  he was gonna host the   oscars  and i don\u2019t know what you know about kevin  but i know kevin hart is damn near perfect  as close to perfect as anybody i\u2019ve ever seen  in fact  kevin is precisely four tweets shy of being perfect  ten years ago  kevin had made some very homophobic comments  and i\u2019m not gonna repeat what he said\u2026 because this is atlanta  you know what i mean  i\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of gay men here tonight\u2026 with their wives  far be it from me to offend anybody  all right  i\u2019ll tell you what he said  but just remember  these are not my words  these were kevin\u2019s words  and it was a long time ago  and i\u2019m paraphrasing  \u2019cause i\u2019m not good at telling other people\u2019s jokes  okay  kevin said\u2026 that if his little son was demonstrating or or or exhibiting  uh  homosexual behavior around the house  that he\u2019d chastise him  he\u2019d say  \u201chey  that\u2019s gay \u201d and then he said he would smash a dollhouse over that child\u2019s head  ooh  the gay community was furious  and i don\u2019t blame \u2019em  i got a lot of gay friends  and all of them     of them  all have told me fuckin\u2019 horror stories about the shit they had to go through just to be themselves  crazy  crazy stories  and in all those stories  i gotta say  not one of them has ever mentioned anything like\u2026 their father smashing a fucking dollhouse over their head  \u2018cause  clearly  kevin was joking  think about it  you would have to buy this n i g g a a dollhouse to break it over his head in the first place  does that sound right  is anybody gonna do that  the gay community was upset  and then they put so much pressure on the academy of motion pictures and sciences that they went to kevin and said  \u201cif you don\u2019t apologize to that community  then you cannot host these oscars \u201d and then kevin said  \u201cfuck it  i quit \u201d and then he went on every talk show in america and apologized for six weeks  kevin fucked up  i understand the mistake he made because i\u2019ve made the same mistake early in my career  this is many years ago    years ago  it was when i was doing chappelle\u2019s show  there\u2019s a\u2013 thank you  thank you  on network television  they have a department that\u2019s called standards and practices  this is the department that tells you what you can and cannot say on television  and if you\u2019re doing your job well  you should never hear from \u2019em  but if you\u2019re making chappelle\u2019s show  you\u2019ll hear from these motherfuckers all the time  and remember  this was   years ago  i made a mistake  i didn\u2019t even know i\u2019d done anything wrong  i had written a sketch\u2026 that had the word\u2026 \u201cf a g g o t\u201d in it  so i had to go to standards and practices  they call me up  i don\u2019t know why they\u2019re calling me  but i like the lady that runs the department  she\u2019s usually really fair and was one of my favorite people i\u2019ve ever worked with  so she sits me down  we have a nice conversation  she tells me  \u201coh  the sketches are great \u201d i go  \u201coh  fantastic  well  then\u2026 well  then  why am i here \u201d she said  \u201cbecause  david  there\u2019s no way\u2026 that you can ever say the word\u2026 \u201cf a g g o t\u201d on our network  i didn\u2019t know i did anything wrong  i didn\u2019t try to defend myself  i said  \u201call right  fuck it  i\u2019ll take it out  have a good afternoon \u201d and as i was leaving  it occurred to me  \u201chey  hey  ren\u00e9e  quick question  it\u2019s just a question  seriously  i wanna know  like  wh why is it\u2026 why is it that\u2026 that i can say the word \u201cn i g g e r\u201d with impunity\u2026 \u2026but i can\u2019t say the word \u201cf a g g o t\u201d \u201d and she said  \u201cbecause  david  you are not gay \u201d i said  \u201cwell  ren\u00e9e\u2026 i\u2019m not a n i g g e r either \u201d but  you see  what i didn\u2019t realize at the time and what kevin had to learn the hard way is we were breaking an unwritten and unspoken rule of show business  and if i say it  you\u2019ll know that i\u2019m telling you the truth  the rule is that no matter what you do in your artistic expression  you are never  ever  allowed to upset\u2026 the alphabet people  you know who i mean  those people that took    of the alphabet for themselves  i\u2019d say the letters  but i don\u2019t want to conjure their anger  ah  it\u2019s too late now  i\u2019m talking about them l\u2019s and them b\u2019s and them g\u2019s and the t\u2019s  people would be surprised  i have friends of all kinds of letters  everybody loves me and i love everybody  i got friends who are l\u2019s  i got friends who are b\u2019s  and i got friends who are g\u2019s  but the t\u2019s hate my fuckin\u2019 guts  and i don\u2019t blame \u2019em  it\u2019s not their fault  it\u2019s mine  i can\u2019t stop telling jokes about these n i g g a s  i don\u2019t want to write these jokes  but i just can\u2019t stop  you know  you hear all those letters together all the time  \u201clbgt  lbgt \u201d and you think it\u2019s just one big movement  it\u2019s not  all those letters are their own movement  they just travel in the same car together  and\u2026 my guess is\u2026 oh  what is this  high school  this n i g g a probably got a babysitter or something  go and answer your phone  n i g g a  get that shit out of here  i\u2019m\u2026 i\u2019m in the middle of something important  wouldn\u2019t it be funny if we made fun of him and he\u2019s like  \u201cha  ha \u201d and he went outside like  \u201chello \u201d \u201cmama\u2019s dead \u201d \u201coh  no \u201d \u201cmama\u2019s dead \u201d that was a weird timed phone call  wasn\u2019t it  it\u2019s like his phone is gay  like i was saying\u2026 my guess is\u2026 the g\u2019s are driving that car  that makes sense to me  \u2018cause there\u2019s white men in the g\u2019s  and these people are trying to get around  uh  discrimination and oppression  and you know how white dudes are  \u201cwe know these roads  in fact  we built these roads  \u201cthe rest of you  buckle up  we\u2019ll get you to where you want to go \u201d so the g\u2019s are just driving the car  of course  next to the g\u2019s in the passenger seat\u2026 is the l\u2019s  everybody likes the l\u2019s  except for the g\u2019s  i don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about  i just know the g\u2019s don\u2019t like them that much  the g\u2019s always say  like  little subliminal digs on \u2019em  it\u2019s unnecessary shit  it\u2019s not mean  but you know what i mean  they just be like\u2026 \u201ci wouldn\u2019t wear that \u201d and the only thing that breaks the tension between the l\u2019s and the g\u2019s are the b\u2019s in the backseat  that\u2019s right  there you go  everybody scream out when you hear your letter  if there\u2019s one thing that the l\u2019s and the g\u2019s agree on  is it\u2019s that the b\u2019s are fuckin\u2019 gross  they seem greedy to the l\u2019s and the g\u2019s  you know what i mean  \u2018cause they\u2019re just sittin\u2019 in the back seat like  \u201cyeah  man  i\u2019ll fuck anybody in this car  what\u2019s going on  man \u201d and sitting next to the b\u2019s  all the way in the backseat by themselves looking out the window\u2026 that\u2019s the t\u2019s  everybody in the car respects the t\u2019s  but everyone also\u2026 resents the t\u2019s  it\u2019s not the t\u2019s\u2019 fault  but everyone in the car just feels like the t\u2019s are making the trip take longer  anything the t\u2019s say gets on everybody\u2019s nerves  and then  the t\u2019s don\u2019t even say anything bad  they just be in the back talking to themselves  \u201chm\u2026 \u201ci\u2019m hot \u201d \u201cshut up  shut the fuck up  okay  you should roll the window down  you\u2026 bitch  i don\u2019t know what you\u2026\u201d \u201cwhat  i just said i was hot  can you pull over at the next exit  i need to use the restroom \u201d \u201cthere is not a restroom for you for four states  n i g g a  will you just shut the fuck up so we can get where we\u2019re going \u201d and just when that car can\u2019t get any more tense  the q\u2019s are a hitchhiker that they pick up on the road  some white dude in booty shorts just walking in the freeway  the g\u2019s see him  \u201chm  that guy might be one of us  hey  are you okay  you need some help \u201d and he come over there with them booty shorts  leaning on the window  \u201chey  what\u2019s going on  fellas \u201d lady  whatever pronoun makes you feel comfortable in the back  yeah  i don\u2019t really know where i\u2019m going  i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m gay or i\u2019m straight or whatever  all i know for sure is that  um\u2026 i really want to get in this car \u201d and they make him get in and sit between the b\u2019s and the t\u2019s  i feel bad for t\u2019s  but they\u2019re so confusing  and it\u2019s not all my fault  i i feel like they need to take some responsibility for my jokes  \u2018cause i didn\u2019t come up with this idea on my own  this idea that a person can be born in the wrong body  but they have to admit that\u2019s a fucking hilarious predicament  it\u2019s really fucking funny  if it happened to me  you\u2019d laugh  wouldn\u2019t you  that wouldn\u2019t be funny if it happened to me  i think it would be  what if\u2026 what if it did  what if\u2026 what if i was\u2026 what if i was chinese  but\u2026 but born in this n i g g a body  that\u2019s not funny  and for the rest of my life  i had to go around making that face  \u201chey  everybody  i\u2019m chinese \u201d and everyone gets mad  \u201cstop making that face  that\u2019s offensive \u201d  \u201cwhat \u201d \u201cthis is how i feel inside \u201d \u00a0 it\u2019s hard not to write these jokes  it\u2019s hard not to think about it  even when i watch sports  i\u2019d be thinking about it  like  think about it  okay  say\u2026 say lebron james  uh  changed his gender  you know what i mean  okay  can he stay in the nba  or  because he\u2019s a woman  does he have to go to the wnba where he will score   points a game  what does it actually mean to be equal  you know what i mean  like  if women are actually equal to men  then there would be no wnba  would there  you would just be good enough to play in the nba with us  or  here\u2019s another idea that\u2019s going to be very controversial  you could\u2026 shut the fuck up  i\u2019m sorry  ladies  i just\u2026 i got a fucking me too headache  y\u2019all is killing me right now  it\u2019s really fuckin\u2019 tough to watch what\u2019s going on  you know  ladies  i said it in my last special  and i got in a lot of trouble for this  i told you  you were right  but the way you\u2019re going about it is not going to work  but i\u2019m biased  i said it  louis c k  was a very good friend of mine before he died in that terrible masturbation accident  and it was his room  you read the story  he was masturbating in his own room  that\u2019s where you supposed to masturbate  then he said  \u201chey  everybody  i\u2019m gonna pull my dick out \u201d nobody ran for the door or nothing like that  they all just kind of hung out  like  \u201ci wonder if this guy is serious \u201d and he came on his own stomach  there it is  what is the threat  have any women ever seen a guy that just came on his own stomach  this is the least threatening motherfucker the earth has ever seen  all you see is shame in their face and\u2026 cum dripping down like pancake butter  he didn\u2019t do anything that you can call the police for  i dare you to try  call the police on him  \u201chello  police  yes  i am\u2026 i am on the other line with comedian louis c k   and i think that he is masturbating while i\u2019m on the phone \u201d you know what the police are gonna say in atlanta  \u201cwell  what are you guys talking about  mm hm  mm hmm \u201d they ruined this n i g g a\u2019s life  and now he\u2019s coming back playing comedy clubs  and they acting like if he\u2019s able to do that  that\u2019s gonna hurt women  what the fuck is your agenda  ladies  is\u2013 is sexism dead  no  in fact  the opposite happened  i said it was gonna get worse  and they said i was tone deaf  but eight states  including your state  have passed the most stringent anti abortion laws this nation has seen since roe v  wade  i\u2026 i told you  i told you  i\u2019ll be real with you  and i know nobody gives a fuck what i think anyway   uh\u2026 i\u2019m not for abortion   oh  shut up  n i g g a  i\u2019m not for it  but i\u2019m not against it either  it all depends\u2026 on who i get pregnant  i don\u2019t care\u2013 i\u2019ll tell you right now  i don\u2019t care what your religious beliefs are or anything  if you have a dick  you need to shut the fuck up on this one  seriously  this is theirs  the right to choose is their unequivocal right  not only do i believe they have the right to choose  i believe that they shouldn\u2019t have to consult anybody   except for a physician\u2026 \u2026about how they exercise that right  gentleman  that is fair  and ladies  to be fair to us  i also believe if you decide to have the baby  a man should not have to pay  that\u2019s fair  if you can kill this motherfucker  i can at least abandon \u2019em  it\u2019s my money  my choice  and if i\u2019m wrong  then perhaps we\u2019re wrong  so  figure that shit out for yourselves  i mean  really  uh  what the fuck are we doing  i can\u2019t live in this new world you\u2019re proposing  and meanwhile  while we\u2019re worrying about this other shit  look at what\u2019s happening  they just killed another   people in a mass shooting in virginia beach  this shit\u2019s happening every week  it happens so much  i\u2019m almost\u2013 i don\u2019t care anymore  i came home early from the road  i had a      suit on  \u2019cause life\u2019s been going good  and i got home early  and dinner was cookin\u2019  you ever come home when dinner\u2019s cookin\u2019  doesn\u2019t that smell good  and my son saw me  and he was like  \u201cdad\u2019s home \u201d and he got up from the table and ran over to give me a hug  but he had chicken grease all over his face  so i stiffed on him  like  \u201cyo  yo  yo  yo  yo  my man  my man  watch these threads  son  this is an expensive suit  i don\u2019t want you to get that chicken grease all over me \u201d a and he was like  \u201cwhat the f\u2026 chicken grease  dad  this is duck \u201d hmm  a tear came out of my eyes  i never dreamt i\u2019d do so well in life that i\u2019d raise a n i g g a with duck grease all over his face  and we sat down  we just talked about everything  i was telling my wife about how my shows were going  and i told her my trans jokes  and she was like  \u201coh  i hate that joke \u201d and you know why she hates the joke  \u2018cause she\u2019s asian  but you know what i mean  i don\u2019t make that face at the house  u unless we\u2019re really fightin\u2019  and me and her  we weren\u2019t arguing  but you know what i mean  she\u2019s like  \u201cyou need to stop doing that \u201d and then  i tried to change the subject  \u201coh  how is school going  boys \u201d and my son\u2019s telling me  \u201cwell  we didn\u2019t have school today  technically \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cwhat\u2026 what\u2019s going on \u201d he said  \u201cwell there was  like  a school shooting drill \u201d i never heard of this  you know what this is  they have drills that they make kids do  uh  where they practice what to do if somebody comes to shoot up their school  i\u2019d never heard of that before  i was like  \u201cwhat the fuck \u201d i had to tell my sons the truth  i didn\u2019t want to tell them this shit  \u201cson\u2026 son  listen to me  fuck that drill  if somebody comes to your school and wants to shoot it up  i\u2019m just gonna be honest with you  you probably gonna get shot  n i g g a  i\u2019m just being real  you got a famous dad  i talk a lot of shit  they gonna be gunning for you  little buddy  just stay low and run in a zigzag pattern  and don\u2019t try to save anybody  son  do you understand me \u201d why would you have kids rehearse for some shit they have no control over  all you\u2019re doing is training these kids to worry  it\u2019s the stupidest drill i\u2019ve ever heard of  and while you\u2019re in there training \u2019em during these drills  well  aren\u2019t you training the shooter  too  this n i g g a\u2019s in here listening and learning like the other kids  sittin\u2019 in the back\u2026 \u201cso  where are we supposed to meet  okay \u201d all right  if you\u2019re a parent  this shit is terrifying  this shit is real scary  all the parents is looking at each other crazy  because we know  as parents  that one of us is raising the shooter  we just don\u2019t know which one of us it is  all we know for sure\u2026 is that if you\u2019re a white parent  the chances that it\u2019s you\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s exponentially higher than the rest of us  shooting up school is a white kids\u2019 game  it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 crazy  you know  i hated school  too  it never occurred to me\u2026 kill everybody in school  it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 crazy  just do what i did  n i g g a  try some things  \u201chave you skipped school  n i g g a  skip school  take a walk and meet some other kids  fuck school  n i g g a  try drugs  have you tried drugs out  n i g g a  that might\u2026\u201d some scary shit  i\u2019ve given this a lot of thought  i don\u2019t see any peaceful way to disarm america\u2019s whites  there\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s going to save this country from itself  same thing that always saves this country from itself  and that is african americans  right  and i know the question that a lot of y\u2019all have in your minds is  \u201cshould we do it \u201d yeah  fuck yeah  we should do it  listen  no matter what they say or how they make you feel  remember  this is your country  too   it is incumbent upon us\u2026 to save our country  and you know what we have to do  this is a fuckin\u2019 election year  we gotta be serious  every able bodied african american must register for a legal firearm  that\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll change the law  i hate guns  personally  i can\u2019t stand \u2019em  yeah  but i have several  i don\u2019t want \u2019em  but i feel like i need \u2019em  don\u2019t forget where i live  i live in ohio  and anyone that knows anything about ohio knows that even the word \u201cohio\u201d is an old native american word  it means  literally  uh  \u201cland of poor white people \u201d and i don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on down here  but in my experience  uh  poor white people love  and  i mean  they fucking love\u2026 heroin  they can\u2019t seem to get enough of it  i didn\u2019t know what i was looking at at first  i was driving  like  \u201cwhy are all these white people so sleepy out here \u201d it\u2019s really bad  matter of fact  i was coming out of the nightclub the other night in dayton  and i had parked my car in the alley  and no one was out  i didn\u2019t have no bodyguards or nothing  i was home  i figured everything was fine  and as soon as i open my car door  all by myself  suddenly  uh  one of these heroin addicted whites just pops out of a trash can  it scared the shit out of me  i screamed  \u201caah \u201d and then  i realized it was a woman  she was fucked up  she was like\u2026 \u201chey  man  hey  man  relax  okay  i\u2019m sick  all right  i need some drugs  man  please  i\u2019ll suck your dick for five dollars  man \u201d i was like  \u201cick\u2026 two \u201d obviously  i\u2019m joking  this opioid crisis is a crisis  i see it everyday  it\u2019s as bad as they say  it\u2019s ruining lives  it\u2019s\u2026 destroying families  sadly  you know what it reminds me of  seeing it  reminds me of us  these white folks look exactly like us during the crack epidemic  you know  it\u2019s really crazy to see  and all this shit they talk about on the news about how divided the nation is  i don\u2019t believe it  i feel like  nowadays  we\u2019re gettin\u2019 a real good look at each other  it\u2019s wild  because i even have insight into how the white community must\u2019ve felt watching the black community go through the scourge of crack\u2026 because i don\u2019t care either  \u201chang in there  whites  just say no  what\u2019s so hard about that \u201d remember when y\u2019all said that to us  but it\u2019s okay  there\u2019s no grudges  now you finally got it right  once it started happening to your kids  you realize it\u2019s a health crisis  these people are sick  they are not criminals  they are sick  be that as it may  i\u2019m armed to the teeth  first gun i bought was a   gauge shotgun  i didn\u2019t want the gun  remember  though  i\u2019d moved to a farm and i was sittin\u2019 on the porch  and i see a white dude walking across my property  entitled  like he\u2019s supposed to be there  he had a rifle over his shoulder  too  ain\u2019t that a bitch  i said  \u201cwhat the fuck is this guy doing on my property \u201d i was mad as shit  but i was unarmed  so  i ended up just waving to this motherfucker like a bitch  i was just  like\u2026 and as soon as he got far enough away  i ran to my car and sped to kmart  this is in a rural white area  and remember  i was nervous  \u2019cause the guy was on my property  i\u2019m black  and i was sweating  you know what i mean  and i ran to the gun counter  black and sweaty  sweating and black  and i looked up and i was like\u2026 i looked like a slave or something  i said  \u201ci need a gun  immediately \u201d like that  just like that  the guy didn\u2019t ask no questions  he just\u2026 grabbed a   gauge shotgun  handed it to me  i\u2019d never even held a gun before  i\u2019m like\u2026 \u201cwell  i need\u2026 i need some bullets  too \u201d and the guy reached under the counter  put two boxes of shells on the counter  he said  \u201call right  buddy  which box do you want \u201d i didn\u2019t know  one box had a picture of some ducks on it  the other box had a picture of some deer  i said  \u201cwell  what\u2019s that box with them ducks \u201d he said  \u201coh  that there\u2019s bird shot \u201d and then he goes just like this  i\u2019m not exaggerating  he goes  \u201cthat won\u2019t kill a man \u201d he said  \u201cit\u2019ll just pepper him up nicely \u201d i said  \u201cwhat the fuck  pepper \u201d you know what it means to pepper a motherfucker up  it means that when the shell explodes  hot bbs will shoot out of the barrel of the gun  not killing a motherfucker  but penetrating their skin and shallow flesh  boy  that\u2019s gotta hurt  hot bbs  \u201caah  aaaah \u201d remember when dick cheney shot a motherfucker in the face and he lived  that was bird shot  i said  \u201cwell  what\u2019s that box with the deer on it \u201d he goes  \u201coh  that there is buckshot  that\u2019ll put a hole in a goddamn truck if you wanted to  so  which box do you want \u201d and he picked the one with the deer up and shook it  i thought he was trying to trick me  i was like  \u201cdo you have a box  uh  with a picture of a white dude trespassing on it  \u2018cause\u2026 \u2026 that\u2019s exactly the strength i\u2019m looking for  but i didn\u2019t know that if you\u2019re defending your home with a shotgun  the formula dictates that you\u2019re supposed to buy both boxes  this was not a formula that i was familiar with  it goes like this  there\u2019s six shots in a   gauge shotgun  so when you load the gun  you load it like this  first shot  bird shot  next shot  buckshot  bird shot  and then after that  gun\u2019s jamaican  buckshot  buckshot  buckshot  but you gotta picture it  okay  like  say i\u2019m in bed and i\u2019m sleepin\u2019  and suddenly  my wife wakes me up  \u201cdavid  david  wake up \u201d and i\u2019m like  \u201cuh  oh  look who\u2019s come around \u201d and i pull my dick over the top of my pajamas  and she\u2019s says  \u201cno  i hear somethin\u2019 \u201d i go  \u201coh  this bitch \u201d so i get up out of bed\u2026 uh  grab the gun  i say  \u201cwait here  baby  i\u2019ll go check it out  just lock the door behind me \u201d oh  my god  she\u2019s right  right there in the kitchen is a heroin addicted white and\u2026 he\u2019s digging through the change jar by the door  \u201ci work really hard for that change  i gotta do something \u201d so  first  i rack the shotgun  \u201chey  motherfucker \u201d click clack  that\u2019s a test  that click clack sound will stop a rational human being in their tracks  but  sure enough  this person is not rational  they\u2019re sick on drugs  they\u2019re digging in the change  i gotta act fast  this n i g g a\u2019s almost got       \u201ci warned you \u201d bird shot  and there it goes  hot bb\u2019s will permeate his yellow heroin skin  remember  i\u2019m not killing him  i\u2019m just \u201cpeppering him up nice \u201d he lets out a heroin scream  no  and that should be the end of it  but\u2026 uh oh  i miscalculated  while he\u2019s on the ground screaming  i notice that his teeth are horribly miscolored  that\u2019s not heroin at all  is it  that\u2019s crystal meth  he pops right back up  unscathed  time for the heavy stuff  clack clack  buckshot  and then  if he got a friend with him  i got one more bird shot left  and i repeat the cycle  after that n i g g a  it\u2019s slugs for everybody  and i\u2019ll be in a kitchen full of dying heroin addicts  saying stupid heroin last words  \u201cyou shot me  bro \u201d \u201coh  it hurts  man  it hurts  ah \u201d their last words are always the dumbest words  like\u2026 \u201cwhy is your dick out \u201d i\u2019m just afraid of being attacked  it happens to the best of us  don\u2019t ever forget what happened to that french actor  you know who i\u2019m talking about  jussie smollett  he\u2019s a very french\u2026 a very famous french actor  y\u2019all never heard of jussie smollett  jussie smollett is an actor from france  a and he became famous on a show called empire  and one night  he was in chicago late at night  and was the victim\u2026 he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack  you see  jussie smollett is\u2026 gay  and he is black  not just french  oh  it was a crazy story  apparently  when he\u2019s walking down the street late at night  two white men came out of the shadows  uh\u2026 with maga hats on and beat him up  tied a rope around his neck  called him all kinds of n i g g a s and\u2026 and\u2026 put some bleach on him and ran off into the night  this shit was  like  international news  and everybody was furious  especially in hollywood  it\u2019s all over everybody\u2019s twitter feed and instagram page  \u201cjustice for jussie\u201d and all this shit  the whole country was up in arms  we was talking about it all the time on the news  and\u2026 and  for some reason  uh  african americans  we were like oddly quiet  we were so quiet about this shit that the gay community started accusing the african american community of being homophobic for not supporting him  but what they didn\u2019t understand is that we were supporting him with our silence  because we understood that this n i g g a was clearly lying  none of these details added up at all  he said he\u2019s walking down the street in chicago and and  uh  white dudes come up to him and say  \u201chey  man  aren\u2019t you that f a g g o t n i g g e r from empire \u201d what the fuck  does that sound like how white people talk  i know white people  they don\u2019t talk like that  \u201care you that f a g g o t n i g g e r from empire \u201d they would never say that  it sounds like something\u2026 that i would say  if you\u2019re racist and homophobic  you don\u2019t even know who this n i g g a is  you can\u2019t watch empire  black people never feel sorry for the police  but this time  we even felt sorry for the police  can you imagine if you was a police veteran taking this kid\u2019s police report  \u201cokay  mr  smollett  please  tell me what happened \u201d \u201call right  you\u2026     a m  you left the house at     a m  it was minus   degrees and\u2026  all right  you were walking  you were walking  all right  and\u2026 and where were you going  subway  sandwiches  that\u2019s when the men approached you  did you see them  do you have any\u2013 okay  what did they have on  maga hats  maga hats on in chicago  excuse me  one second  mr  smollett  frank  come here for a second  find out where kanye west was last night \u201d such a fucking outrageous story  he said they put a rope around his neck  has anyone here ever been to chicago  yes  all right  all right  so you\u2019ve been there  now  tell me  how much rope do you remember seeing  who the fuck is carrying rope  like  when did you get mugged  n i g g a  in     who\u2019s got rope  \u2013 who\u2019s got rope  man  that shit was awful  so  okay  i\u2019m doing a show somewhere  and i\u2019m on stage  and i was a little drunk  you know  i figured  \u201cfuck  let me talk about that n i g g a a little bit \u201d i figured it\u2019d be safe  \u2019cause  you know  everybody\u2019s phones are locked up\u2026 and i went in on this kid  i was talking all kinds of shit  now  i didn\u2019t know that there was a journalist in the audience  and unfortunately for me  that motherfucker\u2026 took impeccable notes  he told everybody everything i said  he was even puttin\u2019 the jokes in the headline  the headline said  \u201cdave chappelle says he wants to smash a dollhouse over jussie smollett\u2019s head \u201d i thought for sure when i read that headline  i said  \u201cwell  that\u2019s it for me  i\u2019m canceled \u201d but lucky for me  that very same day  the chicago police caught the motherfuckers that actually did it  and  hilariously  they were both  uh  nigerian  not only were they not white  they were very  very black  they were nigerian  which is the funniest shit  the whole story is funnier now  \u201cthis is maga country  you f a g g o t n i g g e r \u201d \u201cyou f a g g o t n i g g e r \u201d if\u2026 if you\u2019re in a group that i made fun of  then just know that i probably will only make fun of you if i see myself in you  i make fun of poor white people because i was once poor  and i know that the only difference between a poor black person and a poor white person is that a poor white person feels like it\u2019s not supposed to be happening to them  yeah  everything else is the same  i know what it\u2019s like to have a cold house  i wasn\u2019t allowed to touch the thermostat growing up without asking my father  and it would be fuckin\u2019 freezing in the house  i\u2019d be like  \u201cdad  please  can i please just turn the heat up to  like  i don\u2019t know     n i g g a  it\u2019s really cold \u201d and my dad would say  \u201cjust put more clothes on  david \u201d \u201ci

didn\u2019t say it to him  but i said it in front of him so he could hear  i said  \u201ci fuckin\u2019 hate being poor \u201d and my dad got really upset  he didn\u2019t scream or howl  that wasn\u2019t his way  he just threw his newspaper on the floor  and he said  \u201cdavid  david  david  you are not poor \u201d he said  \u201cpoor is a mentality \u201d he said  \u201cit\u2019s a mentality that very few people ever recover from  don\u2019t you forget it  son  you are broke \u201d he said  \u201cthese are just financial circumstances that i hope to overcome one day very soon \u201d and i said  \u201cwell  dad  whatever you want to call this  uh  it\u2019s wildly uncomfortable \u201d there was a big dance coming up in the middle school  i was   years old  i said  \u201cdad

long line of kids waiting behind me while i\u2019m at the door  trying to count out   pennies to get inside  i will never forget this shit as long as i fuckin\u2019 live  oh  man  you know  if

hall  it\u2019s time  any questions  no  walk with me   eerie organ music playing   mechanical whirring   audience applauding and cheering  good evening  hi  i\u2019m john mulaney  nice to meet you  jon brion  ladies and gentlemen  thank you for coming to see me at radio city music hall  i love to play venues where if the guy that built the venue could see me on the stage  he would be a little bit bummed about it  look at this  this is so much nicer than what i\u2019m about to do  it\u2019s really\u2026 it\u2019s really tragic  what a historic and beautiful and deeply haunted building this is  i keep walking through cold spots being like  \u201ci wonder who that used to be \u201d i\u2019ve never seen a ghost  by the way  i asked my mom if she\u2019d ever seen a ghost  that\u2019s where we\u2019re at conversation wise in our relationship as a mother and son  because i\u2019m   and i don\u2019t have any children to talk about and she doesn\u2019t understand my career  so i was home for christmas and we were just eating triscuits in\u00a0silence and i was staring at the floor and i was like  \u201cwell  here goes nothing  \u2018you ever seen a ghost  \u201d and my mom said  \u201cyes \u201d which is the best answer  she said  \u201ci never told you this before but our house  when you were growing up  was haunted \u201d i said  \u201csay more right now \u201d she said  \u201coutside you and your brother\u2019s room  i used to see the ghost of a little girl in a victorian nightgown and then she would walk down the hallway and then she would evaporate \u201d and then my dad said  \u201clet\u2019s change the subject \u201d and i think he was just doing that dad thing of  like  \u201cthis is a weird topic and i want to talk about a book\u00a0i read about world war ii \u201d but the way it came off was\u00a0that he definitely killed that little girl  \u201clet\u2019s change the subject  why are we even talking about penelope\u2026 or whatever her name was  i didn\u2019t kill her  whoever did kill\u00a0her only did it to protect her from this world \u201d none of us really know our fathers  anyway\u2026 my dad is so weird  i\u2019d love to meet him someday  you know  my friend was telling me that his dad used to beat him with a belt and that\u2019s just the setup to my story  so\u2026 forget about that poor son of a bitch  anyway\u2026 he was talking and i was waiting for him to be done so i could talk  so he\u2019s \u201ctalk  talk  talk \u201d it\u2019s my turn next  and\u2026  audience laughing  i said  \u201cmy dad never hit us \u201d my dad is a lawyer and he was a debate team champion  so he would pick us apart psychologically  one time i was at the dinner table when i was like six  because i had to be  my dad goes  \u201chow was school today \u201d i said  \u201cit was good but someone pushed tyler off the seesaw \u201d \u201cand where were you \u201d \u201ci was over on the bench \u201d \u201cand what did you do \u201d

\u201d \u201cyeah  \u2019cause i was sitting over on the bench \u201d \u201clet me ask you this  in nazi germany\u2026\u201d  audience laughing  \u201c \u2026when people saw what the nazis were doing\u00a0and did nothing  were those good people \u201d \u201cno  those are bad people  you gotta stop the nazis \u201d \u201cbut you saw what they were doing\u00a0to tyler and you did nothing

\u201d and the conversation ended  my dad\u2019s a very weird  informal guy  a lot of people ask me if he gave me a sex talk  yes  i think  i was like   years old and\u00a0my dad walked up to me and he said  \u201chello\u2026  chuckles  hello  i\u2019m chip mulaney  i\u2019m your father \u201d and then he said the following  \u201cyou know \u00a0 leonard bernstein\u2026 was one of the great composers and conductors of the   century  but sometimes he would be gay  and according to a biography i read of him  when he was holding back the gay\u00a0part  he did some of his best work \u201d  audience laughing  now we don\u2019t have time to unpack all of that  and i don\u2019t know if he was discouraging me from being gay or encouraging me to be a classical composer  but that is how he thought to phrase it to a   year old boy  how would that ever work  like years later \u00a0i\u2019d be in college about to go down on some rocking twink and i\u2019d be like  \u201cwait a\u00a0second\u2026 what would leonard bernstein do \u201d i\u2019ve never talked to my dad about that  but i figured i would tell all of you   audience laughing  this is so great  thank you for

crowds because this right here  this reminds me of assembly in grade school  and assembly was the only part of school i ever liked  once you leave school  you don\u2019t get to have assembly  this is\u00a0the closest we get in adult life to assembly  \u2018cause look at you all  you\u2019re just sitting there in chairs  looking at a guy with absolutely no expertise  who\u2019s going to talk for a while  although this is different than assembly because you bought tickets  you knew this was coming  assembly you never knew was coming when you were a kid  you just showed up at     a m  and they were like  \u201cput down your stuff  go to the gym \u201d you\u2019re like  \u201cgod  i guess\u00a0they\u2019re\u00a0finally going to kill us all  all right  this is younger than i thought i would be but we are pretty big assholes \u201d you get to the gym and the whole school is sitting on the floor  you\u2019re like  \u201cwhat are we  about to graduate from tuesday \u201d my principal would always come out to kick things off  she\u2019d be like  \u201cchildren  rather than continue to teach you how to read  we have cleared the entire day for this random guy \u201d  imitating new york accent  \u201ci used to smoke crack  as you seven and eight year olds probably know  freebasing is the greatest\u00a0orgasm known to man  but i\u2019m here to tell you there\u2019s hope  i\u2019ve been sober now two weeks  well  weekdays  not weekends  weekends  that\u2019s nunzio\u2019s time \u201d i was once in assembly listening to a guy talk about\u00a0smoking crack  my social studies teacher yelled at me  \u201csit up straight  show some respect \u201d i was like  \u201che\u2019s smoking cocaine \u201d \u201csit up straight\u201d  he\u2019s standing on a   degree angle  or  as junkies call it  first position   audience laughing  i always got yelled at at assembly  that\u2019s right  there was always assembly and then  like  that second assembly to yell at you for how you behaved at the first assembly  they\u2019d be like  \u201cget in here  sit down  i want to talk about what happened yesterday \u201d you\u2019re like eight years old  \u201cwhat\u2019s yesterday \u201d \u201cwe invite a woman here with homemade puppets to teach you about bullying through skits and you laugh at this woman  we noticed you had all been bullying each other and making fun of everything constantly  so we invite a woman with straight gray hair  in a denim dress  with a wrist cast and homemade puppets that all have the same voice to teach you about bullying through skits  and you  ha ha ha  laugh it up  what was so funny about that woman  i want to know  what was so funny about when she couldn\u2019t fit the box of puppets back into the trunk of her dodge neon  what was so hilarious that you all ran to the windows  well  you all missed a valuable lesson on the danger of cliques \u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s a clique \u201d \u201cit\u2019s when a group of people hang out together \u201d \u201coh  you mean like having friends \u201d \u201cno  because these people make fun of other people \u201d \u201coh  you mean like having friends \u201d  audience laughing  the greatest assembly of them all  once a year  stranger danger  yeah  the hottest ticket in town  the bruno mars of assemblies  you are gathered together as a school and you are told never to talk to an adult that you don\u2019t know and you are told this by an adult that you don\u2019t know  we had the same stranger danger speaker every year when i was a kid  his name was detective jj bittenbinder  go ahead and laugh  his name is ridiculous  that was his name  it was jj bittenbinder  he was from the chicago police department  he was a child homicide expert and\u2026   audience is silent   oh  gee   audience laughing  very sorry  radio city  did that make you uncomfortable  well  guess what  you\u2019re adults and he\u2019s not even here  so try being seven years old and you\u2019re sitting five feet away from him  he\u2019s still got blood on his shoes  and he\u2019s looking at you in the eye to tell you for the first time in your very young life that some adults find you incredibly attractive   audience laughing  and they may just have to kill you over it  okay  c\u2019est la vie  go be kids  go have fun  bittenbinder came every year  by the way \u00a0detective jj\u00a0bittenbinder wore three piece suits  he also wore a pocket watch  two years in a row  he wore a cowboy hat  he also had a huge handlebar mustache  none of that matters \u00a0but it\u2019s important to me that you know that  he did not look like his job description  he looked like he should be the conductor on a locomotive powered by confetti  but  instead  he made his living in murder  he was the weirdest goddamn person i ever saw in my entire life  he was a man most acquainted with misery  he could look at a child and guess the price of their coffin   audience laughing  that line never gets a laugh  but once you write it  it stays in the act forever  so bittenbinder came every year with a program to teach us about the violent world waiting for us outside the school gym  and that program was called street smarts  \u201ctime for street smarts with detective jj bittenbinder  shut up  you\u2019re all gonna die  street smarts \u201d that was the general tone  he would give us tips to deal with crime  i will share some of the tips with you this evening  \u201cokay  tip number one  street smarts  let\u2019s say a guy pulls a knife on you to mug you \u201d you remember the scourge of muggings when you were in second and third grade  you know how a mugger thinks  \u201cman  i need cash for drugs right now  hey  maybe that eight year old with the goddamn aladdin wallet that only has blank\u00a0photo laminate pages in it will be able to help \u201d \u201clet\u2019s say a guy pulls a knife on you to mug you  what do you do  you go fumbling for your wallet  and you go fumbling for your wallet  well  in that split second  that\u2019s when he\u2019s going to stab you  so here\u2019s what you do  you kids get yourselves a money clip  okay  you can get these at any haberdashery  you put a    bill in the money clip then when a guy flashes a blade  you go  \u2018you want my money  go get it \u2019 then you run the other direction \u201d and our teachers were like  \u201cwrite that down \u201d  audience laughing  we\u2019re like  \u201cbuy a money clip  engraved  question mark \u201d you go home to your parents  \u201chey  dad  can i have a silver money clip with a    bill in it  please  don\u2019t worry  i\u2019m only going to chuck it into the gutter and run away at the first sign of trouble  the man with the mustache told me to do it \u201d \u201ctip number two  street smarts  let\u2019s say a kidnapper throws you in the back of a trunk\u2026\u201d this was at nine in the morning   audience laughing  \u201clet\u2019s say a kidnapper throws you in the back of a trunk  don\u2019t panic   chuckles  once you get your bearings\u2026 find the carpet that covers the taillight  peel back the carpet  make a fist  punch the taillight out the back of the car  thus creating a hole in the back of the automobile  then stick your little hand out and wave to oncoming motorists to let them know that something hinky is going on \u201d can you imagine driving behind that   imitating a thud  i think they\u2019re turning left   audience laughing  \u201ctip number three  street smarts  you kids have no upper body strength \u201d and we were like  \u201cwe

throw him off his rhythm \u201d that was a big thing with bittenbinder  throwing pedophiles off their rhythm  \u201che\u2019s not gonna know how to fight back with two little sneakers coming at him \u201d  audience laughing  \u201cif the lindbergh baby had steel toe boots  he\u2019d still\u00a0be alive today  street smarts \u201d yeah  he was not a \u201cspoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down\u201d kind of guy  he was more like  \u201cbrush your teeth  now  boom  orange juice  that\u2019s life \u201d bittenbinder  he didn\u2019t want us to not get kidnapped  he wanted us to almost get kidnapped and then fight the guy off using weird  psych out  back room chicago violence  like here\u2019s what he wanted to see on the news  \u201cwe\u2019re here with seven year old john mulaney who fended off a kidnapper earlier today  how did you do it  john \u201d  imitating heavy chicago accent  \u201cwell  thank ya for askin\u2019  i used the bittenbinder method  when i saw the perp approachin\u2019  i chewed up a tab of alka seltzer i carry with me at all times  this created a foaming at the mouth appearance that made it look like i had rabies  now i\u2019ve thrown him off his rhythm  then i reach into his jacket pocket where i had planted a gram of coke and i went  \u2018whoa  what the fuck is this \u2019 and he goes  \u2018that\u2019s not mine  i never seen that before \u2019 i go  \u2018boo hoo  it\u2019s in your jacket  you\u2019re doing two to ten and\u00a0your kids are going into social services \u2019 now he\u2019s cryin\u2019  then i grab a telephone book and i beat him on the torso with it  \u2018cause as any chicago cop will tell ya  a phone book doesn\u2019t leave bruises \u201d \u201cwell  that was seven year old john mulaney  currently being sued for police brutality \u201d  audience laughing  bittenbinder told me things that haunt me to this day  he came one year for assembly  he goes  \u201cokay  when you get kidnapped\u2026\u201d not if  when   audience laughing  \u201cokay  so when you get kidnapped  the place\u00a0where the guy grabs ya  in the biz we call that the primary location  okay  your odds of coming back alive from the primary location  about     but if you are taken to a secondary location  your odds of coming back alive are slim to none \u201d i am   years old and i am still terrified of secondary locations  if i\u2019m at a place  i never want to go to another place  i\u2019ll be at a wedding reception and someone\u2019ll be like  \u201cyou coming to the hotel bar after  we\u2019re all gonna get drinks and keep the party going \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cnah  sister  you\u2019re not getting me to no secondary location  you want it  go get it \u201d street smarts  stay alert out there  i thought i was going to be murdered my entire childhood  in high school people were like  \u201cwhat are your top three colleges \u201d i was like  \u201ctop three colleges  i thought i would be dead in a trunk with my hand hanging out of the taillight by now \u201d i went to college \u00a0for the whole time  holy shit  right  i just got a letter from my college  which was fun \u2019cause mail  you know  so i open up the letter and they said  \u201chey  john  it\u2019s college  you remember \u201d i say  \u201cyes  of course \u201d and they said\u2026 how did they phrase it  they said  \u201cgive us some money \u201d  audience laughing  \u201cas a gift  we want a gift  but only if it\u2019s money \u201d i found this peculiar  you see  what had happened  new york  was that when i was a student  i had paid them tuition money  every semester  two semesters a year  for four years  i don\u2019t remember exactly what it was  but rounding up  back in   dollars  it was about      a semester  two semesters a year  for four years  so it was about      a year for four years  so it was about       okay  so roughly speaking  i gave my college about       okay  so you might say that i already gave them      and now you have the audacity to ask me for more money  what kind of a cokehead relative\u2026  audience cheering  what kind of a cokehead relative is my college  you spent it already  i gave you more money than the civil war cost and you fucking spent it already  where\u2019s my money  i felt like jimmy stewart in it\u2019s a wonderful life when he\u2019s screaming at his uncle billy   as jimmy stewart  \u201cwhere\u2019s the money  where\u2019s that money  you fat motherfucker  where\u2019s my money  stay down on the ground  you motherfucker \u201d that\u2019s not the dialogue  but do you remember that scene from it\u2019s a wonderful life  great movie  frank capra     a hundred and twenty thousand dollars  i have friends i went to college with and they\u2019re like  \u201cyou should donate and be a good alumnus \u201d and they wear shirts that say \u201cschool\u201d and it\u2019s like  look\u2026 if you\u2019re an adult still giving money to your college  college is a      hooker and you are an idiot who fell in love with her  she\u2019s not going to do anything else for you  it\u2019s done  in their letter they were like  \u201chey  it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve given us money \u201d i was like  \u201chey  it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve housed and taught me  i thought our transaction was over  i gave you      and you gave me a weird cinder block room with a reservoir dogs poster on it and the first real heartbreak of my life  and probably hpv  and then we called it a day \u201d probably   audience laughing  also  what did i get for my money  what is college   babbles   audience laughing  stop going until we figure it out  because i went to college  i have no idea what it was  i went to college  i was   years old  i looked like i was    i lived like a goddamn ninja turtle  i didn\u2019t drink water the entire time  i lived on cigarettes and alcohol and adderall  college was like a four year game show called do my friends hate me or do i just need to go to sleep  but instead of winning money  you lose\u00a0      by the way  i agreed to give them      when i was   years old  with no\u00a0attorney present  that\u2019s illegal  they tricked me  they tricked me like brendan dassey on making a murderer  they tricked me like poor brendan  they pulled me out of high school  i was in sweatpants  all confused  two guys in clip on ties are like  \u201ccome on  son  do the right thing  sign here and be an english major \u201d and i was like  \u201cokay \u201d yes  you heard me  an english major   i paid         audience cheering  how dare you clap  how dare you clap for the worst financial decision i ever made in my life  i paid      for someone to tell me to go read jane austen and then i didn\u2019t   audience laughing  that\u2019s the worst use of   grand i can possibly fathom  other than if you  like  bought a duffel bag of fake cocaine  no  i take it back  that\u2019s a better use of the money  \u2019cause i know you\u2019d be disappointed when you open up the duffel bag and you realize it\u2019s not real cocaine  it\u2019s like powdered baby aspirin or whatever they do  but at least you have baby aspirin  and maybe you have a baby and one day your baby goes  \u201coh  my head \u201d and you go  \u201chey  i\u2019ve got something for you  come here  little guy \u201d and you dump it out on a mirror  you make it nice for the baby  you make it nice  you cut it up into lines with your laundry card or whatever and you make it nice  and your baby takes his sippy cup straw and he holds it in his little ravioli sized baby fist and he leans over\u2013  snorts  and he snorts up the baby aspirin  and he gets rid of his baby headache  plus you get a duffel bag   audience laughing  that is way better than walking across a stage at graduation \u00a0hungover  in a gown  to accept a certificate for reading books that i didn\u2019t read   audience laughing  strolling across a stage  the sun in my eyes  my family watching as i sweat vodka and ecstasy  to receive a four year degree in a language that i already spoke   audience cheering  i don\u2019t mean to sound down on donating   chuckles  it\u2019s good to give to charities  you know  my wife and i just gave a bunch of stuff to goodwill  we were moving apartments  we had a bunch of clothes and furniture  so we made a whole day out of it  we made these big piles of clothes  we put the piles into these big boxes  then we put the boxes into the back of my car  and then they stayed there for four months  and then one day my wife said  \u201chey  you took that stuff to goodwill  right \u201d and i said  \u201cof course i did  on an unrelated note  i\u2019m going to walk out the front door right now \u201d so then i had to speed to goodwill really fast  it was charitable  but it was also fast and violent  because i was throwing boxes at\u00a0people  the boxes were so heavy i couldn\u2019t even say what was in them  i was like  \u201cthis one\u2019s shirts  i got a bunch of shirts  take \u2019em away \u201d the guy tried to give me a big receipt  he\u2019s like  \u201ctake this receipt for the clothing for your taxes \u201d how do i write that on my taxes  \u201cdear irs \u00a0please deduct from my federal income tax one xxl billabong t shirt from youth  it was too big  my mom said it could be a sleep shirt  please deduct this from my   income \u201d that sleep shirt bullshit  \u201cwell  if it\u2019s too big you can just wear it as a sleep shirt \u201d no  i get that  mom  but why don\u2019t we just tell our relatives that i\u2019m a four year old boy and i don\u2019t wear a man\u2019s xxl\u00a0t shirt  \u201cbecause we don\u2019t say that when someone gives us a gift because that would\u00a0not be polite \u201d oh  i get it  so rather than violate these meaningless politeness rules  i\u2019ll just go to bed in a smock like goddamn ebenezer scrooge  why don\u2019t you give me a candle for looking in the mirror and a floppy hat and i\u2019ll tremble\u00a0off\u00a0to bed in my long victorian nightgown  was there ever even\u00a0a ghost  mother  or was the dead victorian girl you saw just me all along   audience cheering  so that\u2019s why you can\u2019t give to charity  i\u2019m kidding  i like to throw an \u201ci\u2019m kidding\u201d at the ends of jokes now  in case the jokes are ever played in court  you ever heard a joke played in court  never goes well  they\u2019re like  \u201c\u2018and that\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t give\u2026 to charity \u2019 is that something you find funny  mr  mulaney \u201d um\u2026 at the time   chuckles  i found out recently that jokes don\u2019t do well in court  so  some friends of mine were sued in college for property damage  and they were guilty  and the lawsuit dragged on for years and years and eventually i got a call when i was   years old  it was my friend from college  he said  \u201chey  that lawsuit with my neighbor is still dragging on and my neighbor just subpoenaed all my emails from college that mention him or the lawsuit \u201d and i said  \u201cthat\u2019s crazy  but why are you calling me \u201d and he said  \u201cbecause you should be\u00a0concerned \u201d  audience laughing  he said  \u201ci have an email here from junior year where i wrote  \u2018hey  guys \u00a0i\u2019m going to miss practice tonight because i have to meet with my neighbor about that lawsuit thing \u2019 and you replied \u00a0\u2018hey  do you want me to kill that guy for you  because it sounds like he sucks and i will totally kill that guy for you  okay  see you at improv practice  \u201d  audience laughing  of all the sentences in that email i would be ashamed to have read out loud in a court of law  i think the top one is \u201csee you at improv\u00a0practice \u201d strange  the passage of time  i\u2019m not that old  i\u2019m    that is not old  but i am in a new phase right before old called \u201cgross \u201d  audience laughing  i never knew about this  but i am now gross  i am damp all the time  i am damp now and i will be damp later   chuckles  like the back of a dolphin  my back  i am slick  the butt part of my pants is a little damp a lot and i don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything serious\u2026 but isn\u2019t it  though  and\u2026 i\u2019ll be sitting at a restaurant and i\u2019ll get up and i\u2019ll be like  \u201cwhat did i sit in \u201d and it was me  i\u2019m gross now  i\u2019ve been talking through burps  i never used to do this  when i was a kid and i wanted to burp  i\u2019d be like  \u201csilence \u201d blagh  now i\u2019m trying to push \u2019em down and muscle through \u2019em  i\u2019ll be at dinner  just doing the bread and the seltzer  filling up like a hot air balloon  and then i\u2019m like\u2026  belches  \u201cdid you say you were going to italy  because we have a travel\u2013 she has a travel agent if\u2013  exhales  i\u2019m going to the kitchen  does anyone need anything  from the\u2026  belches  anyone need anything \u201d just take a pause  john  i\u2019m gross  i have hair on my shoulders now  i don\u2019t even have a joke for that  that\u2019s how much i hate that shit   audience laughing  i was sitting up in bed a few weeks ago like\u2026  groans  you know  life  and my wife was rubbing my shoulders  which was very nice of her  but then she started singing to herself  \u201cmonkey  monkey  monkey man \u201d  audience laughing  \u201cmonkey  monkey  monkey man \u201d not at me  not to be mean  this was a song from deep in her subconscious  i don\u2019t even think she was aware she was singing it  but it was certainly not the first time she had sung it  i don\u2019t know what my body is for other than just taking my head from room to room   audience laughing  and it\u2019s not getting any better  i\u2019m    but i\u2019m still like  \u201chey  when am i going to get big and strong \u201d this is it  it\u2019s just going to be this  i\u2019m like an iphone  it\u2019s going to be worse versions of this every year  plus i get super hot in the middle of the afternoon for no reason  as i get older  it\u2019s tough to not get grumpy  it\u2019s tempting  i get grumpy about some things  like  i can\u2019t listen to any new songs because every new song is about how tonight is the night and how we only have tonight  that is such   year old horseshit  i want to write songs for people in their   called \u201ctonight\u2019s no good  how about wednesday  oh  you\u2019re in dallas on wednesday  okay  well  let\u2019s just not see each other for eight months and it doesn\u2019t matter at all \u201d  audience cheering  i\u2019m trying to stay nice though  because when i was a kid  i was raised that you should be nice to everyone in every situation because you never know their story  but now  at the end of my life  i don\u2019t know  because a lot of people don\u2019t seem that nice and they seem to be doing fine in the world  or maybe they have different definitions of what it means to be nice  that\u2019s something you figure out as you get older and meet new people  not everyone thinks the same things are nice  you learn that especially when you get jobs  i had a very weird job in my mid   for about four and a half years  i was a writer right across the street over at\u00a0 saturday night live  it was very exciting  yeah   audience cheering  it was great  i loved it  if you haven\u2019t seen the show  you gotta check it out  they have a host and a musical guest  oh  my god  you\u2019re going to love it  real quick tangent  okay  my favorite host ever introducing a musical guest was this  the host was sir patrick stewart  the great sir patrick stewart  and this is how he introduced the musical guest  \u201cladies and gentlemen  salt n pepa \u201d  audience laughing  like he was surprised by pepa  like minutes before they\u2019d been  \u201csir patrick  we can\u2019t find pepa anywhere \u201d and he\u2019s like  \u201cif we must go on with\u00a0salt alone  we will\u00a0go on\u00a0with salt alone \u201d and they were like  \u201cthree  two  one \u201d and pepa burst through the door and he\u2019s like  \u201cladies and gentlemen  salt and\u2026 what\u2019s this  pepa \u201d famous people are weird as shit  they\u2019re all weird  your suspicions are correct  and they would all come

brave  i\u2019ve never really cared about politics  never talked about \u2019em much  but then  last november  the strangest thing happened   audience laughing  now  i don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been following the news  but i\u2019ve been keeping my ears open and it seems like everyone everywhere is super mad about everything all the time  i try to stay a little optimistic  even though i will admit  things are getting pretty sticky  here\u2019s how i try to look at it  and this is just me  this guy being the president  it\u2019s like there\u2019s a horse loose in a hospital  it\u2019s like there\u2019s a horse loose in a hospital  i think eventually everything\u2019s going to be okay  but i have no idea what\u2019s going\u00a0 to happen next  and neither do any of you  and neither do your parents  because there\u2019s a horse loose in the hospital  it\u2019s never happened before  no one knows what the horse is going to do next  least of all the horse  he\u2019s never been in a hospital before  he\u2019s as confused as you are  there\u2019s no experts   audience cheering  they try to find experts on the news  they\u2019re like  \u201cwe\u2019re joined now by a man that once saw a bird in the airport \u201d get out of here with that shit  we\u2019ve all seen a bird in the airport  this is a horse loose in a hospital  when a horse is loose in a hospital  you got to stay updated  so all day long you walk around  \u201cwhat\u2019d the horse do \u201d the updates  they\u2019re not always bad  sometimes they\u2019re just odd  it\u2019ll be like  \u201cthe horse used the elevator \u201d  audience laughing  i didn\u2019t know he knew how to do that   audience laughing  the creepiest days are when you don\u2019t hear from the horse at all   audience laughing  you\u2019re down in the operating room like  \u201chey  has anyone\u2026\u201d  audience laughing  \u201chas anyone heard\u2013\u201d  imitates clopping hooves  those are those quiet days when people are like  \u201cit looks like the horse has finally calmed down \u201d and then ten seconds later the horse is like  \u201ci\u2019m gonna run towards the baby incubators and smash \u2019em with my hooves  i\u2019ve got nice hooves and a long tail  i\u2019m a horse \u201d that\u2019s what i thought you\u2019d say  you dumb fucking horse  and then\u2026  audience cheering  then\u2026 then you go to brunch with people and they\u2019re like  \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t be a horse in the hospital \u201d and it\u2019s like  \u201cwe\u2019re well past that \u201d then other people are like  \u201cif there\u2019s gonna be a horse in the hospital  i\u2019m going to say the n word on tv \u201d and those don\u2019t match up at all  and then  for a second  it seemed like maybe we could survive the horse  and then      miles away  a hippo was like  \u201ci have a nuclear bomb and i\u2019m going to blow up the hospital \u201d and before we could say anything  the horse was like  \u201cif you even fucking look at the hospital  i will stomp you to death with my hooves  i dare you to do it  i want you to do it  i want you to do it so i can stomp you with my hooves  i\u2019m so fucking crazy \u201d \u201cyou think you\u2019re fucking crazy  i\u2019m a fucking hippopotamus  i live in a fucking lake of mud  i\u2019m fucking crazy \u201d and all of us are like  \u201cokay \u201d like poor andy cohen at those goddamn reunions  \u201cokay \u201d and then  for a second  we were like  \u201cmaybe the horse catcher will catch the horse \u201d and then the horse is like  \u201ci have fired the horse catcher \u201d  audience laughing  he can do that  that shouldn\u2019t be allowed no matter who the horse is  i don\u2019t remember that in hamilton   audience laughing  sometimes  if you make fun of the horse  people will get upset  these are the people that opened the door for the horse  i don\u2019t judge anyone  but sometimes i ask people  i go  \u201chey  how come you opened the door for the horse \u201d and they go  \u201cwell  the hospital was inefficient \u201d  audience laughing  or sometimes they go  \u201cif you\u2019re so mad at the horse  how come you weren\u2019t mad when the last guy did this three and a half years ago  you\u2019re beating up on the horse when the last guy essentially did the same thing five years ago \u201d first off  get out of here with your facts  you\u2019re like the kid at the sleepover who  after midnight  is like  \u201cit\u2019s tomorrow now \u201d get the fuck out of here with your technicalities  just \u2019cause you\u2019re accurate does not mean you\u2019re interesting  that was fun when we watched beetlejuice tonight  \u201cdon\u2019t you mean last night  it\u2019s after midnight \u201d why don\u2019t you get your sleeping bag and get out of my house  take your\u00a0epipen  take your goddamn\u00a0epipen and get out of my house  but when people say  \u201chow come you were never mad at the last guy \u201d i say  \u201cbecause i wasn\u2019t paying attention \u201d i used to pay less attention before it was a horse  also  i thought the last guy was pretty smart  and he seemed good at his job  and i\u2019m lazy by nature   audience cheering  i\u2019m lazy by nature too  so i don\u2019t check up on people when they seem okay at their job  you may think that\u2019s an ignorant answer but it\u2019s not  it\u2019s a great answer  if you left your baby with your mother tonight  you\u2019re not going to race home and check the nanny cam  but if you leave your baby with gary busey\u2026  audience laughing  and now there\u2019s nazis again   audience laughing  when i was a kid nazis was just\u00a0an analogy you would use to decimate your child during an argument at the dinner table   audience laughing  now there\u2019s new nazis  i don\u2019t care for these new nazis and you may quote me on that  these new nazis  \u201cjews are the worst  jews ruin everything  and jews try to take over your life \u201d it\u2019s like  \u201cyou know what  motherfucker  my wife is jewish  i know all that  how do you know all that \u201d  audience laughing  i\u2019m allowed to make fun of my wife  i asked her and she said yes   audience laughing  i\u2019ve been married for about three and a half years now  and i was going out on tour\u2026  cheering  thank you very much  and i love and respect my wife very much  so i said to her  \u201cwe\u2019ve been married for three and a half years \u201d and she knew that  i said  \u201cdo you mind if i still make fun of you on stage  and my wife said  \u201cyeah  you can make fun of me  but just don\u2019t say that i\u2019m a bitch and that you don\u2019t like me \u201d i was like  \u201cthe bar is so much lower than i ever imagined  that\u2019s it \u201d also  i wouldn\u2019t say that  what kind of show would that even be  hello  my wife is a bitch  and i don\u2019t like her  that\u2019s like a support group for men in crisis  with keynote speakers jon voight and alec baldwin   audience laughing  also  i would never say that  not even as a joke  that my wife is a bitch and i don\u2019t like her  that is not true  my wife is a bitch and i like her so much   audience cheering  she is a dynamite  five foot  jewish\u00a0bitch and she\u2019s the best  she and i have totally different styles  when my wife walks down the street  she does not give a shit what anyone thinks of her in any situation  she\u2019s my hero  when i walk down the street  i need everybody  all day long  to like me so much  it\u2019s exhausting  my wife said that walking around with me is like walking around with someone who\u2019s running for mayor of nothing   audience laughing  my wife and i went to best buy to get a tv  we didn\u2019t end up getting the tv  i was afraid that the best buy guy was going to be mad at me  so i bought an hdmi cable   audience laughing  i go to the register with anna  my wife\u2019s name anna  she\u2019s standing next to me  i hand the guy the hdmi cable  he takes it  he scans it  he says  \u201cdo you have a best buy rewards card \u201d and i said  \u201cno  i wish \u201d  audience laughing  and then my wife said  \u201cjesus christ \u201d and fully walked away from me  walked all the way to the laser printers and just stood there  blair witch style  and i\u2019m still up at the register like\u2026  audience laughing  and the guy goes  \u201cdo you want a best buy rewards card \u201d and i said  \u201cno \u201d even though i had just said it was my greatest wish in life  i was hoping he\u2019d believe me  that it was secretly my great wish but that i\u2019m in an abusive marriage with little miss jesus christ over here so i can\u2019t ask for the things i want in public but at home  at night  we argue about it and i\u2019m like  \u201cyou\u2019ll see  one day i\u2019m going to leave you and i\u2019m going to get that best buy rewards card \u201d she\u2019s like  \u201cjesus christ  you\u2019re never going to get that best buy rewards card \u201d my wife is jewish  as i said  i was raised catholic  we have differences in our religious\u00a0upbringings and we realized this recently  not with our kids  because we don\u2019t have any kids  people always ask us  \u201care you going to have kids \u201d and we say no  and then they go \u00a0\u201cnever  you\u2019re never going to have kids \u201d look  i don\u2019t know \u201cnever \u201d fourteen years ago  i smoked cocaine the night before my college graduation  now i\u2019m afraid to get a flu shot  people change   audience laughing  but we don\u2019t have any kids now and it\u2019s great  we have a dog though  we have a four year old french bulldog  her name is petunia   audience cheering  the idea of people applauding for that little monster  just\u2026 i mean  i would never tell her that you applauded  it would go right to her ego  that little monster who just rubs her vulva on the carpet while staring at me in the eye   imitates dog snarling  i know her vulva itches and she needs to rub it  but the thumping of the back paws\u2026 it\u2019s upsetting  i\u2019m just kidding  i love petunia very much  she\u2019s one of my most favorite people i\u2019ve ever met in my life  petunia likes to be very social but she can\u2019t walk very far because she has a flat face  so she can\u2019t breathe by design  but she wants to go out and meet people but we can\u2019t walk her for that long  anyway  this is a long winded way of saying that we bought a stroller for our dog   audience laughing  my wife and i walk around new york city pushing petunia the french bulldog in a stroller  and it\u2019s a big stroller and it has a big black hood  and people lean in to see the baby   audience laughing  and instead they see a gargoyle breathing like chris christie   imitates dog snarling  her paws are sweating  we\u2019re like  \u201che\u2019s sick \u201d  chuckles  but religion came up with petunia recently  my wife and i were talking about cute things that petunia could be involved in  and i said  \u201cwhat if we got like a biblical painting done with petunia in it \u201d and my wife is like  \u201cthat would be so cute  we should do like the last supper \u201d and i was like  \u201coh  my god  that would be so cute  we should do all different french bulldogs as the different apostles \u201d and my wife was like  \u201cwe should have petunia in the middle where jesus is  in front of the turkey \u201d and i was like  \u201cwait  what did you just say \u201d  audience laughing  \u201cdid you say the turkey \u201d and my wife said  \u201cyeah  why \u201d and i said\u2026 i said  \u201cwould you just answer me one question  do you think that in da vinci\u2019s the last supper that jesus of nazareth is sitting in front of a turkey \u201d  audience laughing  and my wife said  \u201cyes  i do \u201d and i said  \u201cthank you for your honesty  would you just\u2013 just one more follow up question  so then what do you think they\u2019re celebrating \u201d  audience laughing  \u201cwhat do you think\u2026 those guys are celebrating \u201d she said  \u201cokay  i don\u2019t get this shit because i wasn\u2019t raised catholic and i\u2019m fucking glad i wasn\u2019t because it\u2019s a fucked up organization \u201d i said  \u201cno  we all know that \u201d  audience laughing  \u201cbut what do you think those guys are celebrating \u201d and my wife looked at the floor  and then she looked at me and said  \u201cthanksgiving \u201d  audience laughing  my family went to church every sunday when i was a kid  my wife cannot believe this  she\u2019s like  \u201cyou went every sunday \u201d  \u201cyes \u201d  \u201cwhat if you were out of town \u201d i was like  \u201cthey have them out of town \u201d i don\u2019t know if you grew up going to church and now you don\u2019t  but it can be a\u00a0weird existence  because i like to make fun of\u00a0it all day long  but then if someone like bill maher says  \u201cwho would believe in a man up in the sky \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cmy mommy  so shut the fuck up \u201d  audience cheering  \u201cstop calling my mommy dumb \u201d if you grew up going to church and you have adult friends that didn\u2019t  they have a lot of questions  \u201cwait  so they forced you to go \u201d yeah  i was five  i was forced to go everywhere  no kid is just going to church  riding by on his huffy  like  \u201cwhoa  what\u2019s this place  a weird byzantine temple with green carpeting where everyone has bad breath and i wear clothes that i hate on one of the mornings of my two days off  let\u2019s do this \u201d  audience laughing  but people get very suspicious  they\u2019re like  \u201cwhat did they say in there  what do they do  what did they tell you \u201d i don\u2019t know  it was an hour  that should be the slogan for the catholic church  \u201cit\u2019s an hour \u201d it\u2019s a few stories  normally about a guy with a crazy name whose wife has a normal name  \u201cin that town lives zepheriuses and his wife rachel \u201d how come she gets to be rachel  \u201con their way to galilee  jesus met enos and barak and their wives  kylie and lauren \u201d and you\u2019re like  \u201cwhat  that\u2019s the same joke twice \u201d  audience laughing  then there\u2019s the homily  if you\u2019re not catholic  the homily is when the priest does a book report that is also stand up comedy   audience laughing  it normally begins with a charming anecdote that is fake and never happened  \u201ca woman was at a shopping mall with her young son \u201d what was the woman\u2019s name  hey  father  what was the name of the shopping mall  your story doesn\u2019t have a lot of details  you only had a week to work on it and you\u2019ve had the book for     years   audience laughing  and then there\u2019s some songs normally sung by an usher  one of these ushers that opens the door for you and gives you the pamphlet and they all look like marco rubio   audience laughing  that guy will get up and sing into the microphone  he\u2019s not a singer\u2026 \u2019cause he\u2019s not good at it  but he tries  he sings the psalms  remember the psalms  they\u2019re not songs \u2019cause they don\u2019t rhyme and they\u2019re not good  they\u2019re perfectly named  they\u2019re not quite songs  they\u2019re psalms  it\u2019s a word you\u2019re meant to mishear  \u201ci\u2019m gonna sing a psalm today \u201d what\u2019s that \u00a0you\u2019re gonna sing a song

reason my show is called nanette  is because i named it before i wrote it  i named it at around the time i\u2019d met a woman called nanette\u2026 who i thought was very interesting  so interesting  \u201cnanette \u201d i thought  \u201ci reckon i can squeeze a good hour of laughs out of you  nanette  i reckon \u201d but\u2026 turns out\u2026 no  i met her in a small town caf\u00e9  now  i feel\u2026 i don\u2019t feel comfortable in a small town  i get a bit tense  mainly because i am this situation  and in a small town  that\u2019s all right from a distance  people are like  \u201coh  good bloke \u201d and then\u2026 get a bit closer and it\u2019s like  \u201coh no  trickster woman  what are you doing \u201d i get a lot of side eye  so i feel quite tense in a small town  now  i\u2019m from a small town  a very small town in\u2026 i\u2019m from tasmania  now  of course  tasmania is that little island floating off the\u2026 arse end of mainland australia there  just\u2026 lovely place  famous for a lot of things  potatoes  very\u2026 and our frighteningly small gene pool  that\u2019s\u2026 i wish i was joking  but i am very partial to the potato  very versatile\u2026 vegetable  and not all the branches go directly away from the trunk in our family tree  i will admit  it\u2019s a bit\u2026 topiary  but\u2026 i love tasmania  i loved growing up there  i felt right at home  i did  but i had to leave as soon as i found out i was a little bit lesbian  and you do find out  don\u2019t you  yeah  i got a letter  \u201cdear sir madam \u201d wasn\u2019t a great letter to receive in mid \u2019  tasmania  because the wisdom of the day was if you chose to be gay\u2026 i say \u201cwisdom\u201d  even though homosexuality\u2019s clearly not a choice  wisdom is always relative  you know  and in a place like tasmania  everything\u2019s very relative  but i\u2026 but the wisdom of the day was that  if you chose to be gay  then you should just get yourself a one way ticket to the mainland  and don\u2019t come back  gays\u2026 why don\u2019t you just pack your aids up into a suitcase there and fuck off to mardi gras  because homosexuality was a crime in tasmania \u2019til    not long enough ago  and i took a long time to come to terms with my sexuality  there\u2019s a few reasons for that  a lot of it has to do with bad press  yeah  they didn\u2019t get a good rap when i was growing up  the homosexuals  we didn\u2019t have social media like we do now  but\u2026 \u201cletters to the editor \u201d let me tell you  slow twitter  brutal  but in all the debate about\u2026 homosexuality\u2026 no one ever really talked about the lesbians  you know  it was all the gay men  they\u2019re the problem  anal sex  that\u2019s when the devil will get you  but lesbians  they\u2019re like  \u201cno\u2026 what even are they  what they do  though  really  do they even exist if no one\u2019s watching  really  no  don\u2019t worry about them  no harm in a cuddle \u201d for a long time  i knew more facts about unicorns than i did about lesbians  another reason i struggled with\u2013 there are no facts about unicorns  another reason i struggled to identify as gay was the sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras  precisely that  the mardi gras was my first introduction to my people  i watched it on\u2026 my tv in my little living room in my small town  that was my first introduction to my people  the mardi gras  my people\u2026 flaunting their lifestyle in a parade  i used to watch it  going  \u201cthere they are  my people  they\u2019re busy  aren\u2019t they  gosh  don\u2019t they love to dance and party \u201d i used to sit there and watch it and go  \u201cwhere\u2026 where do the quiet gays\u2026 go  where are the quiet gays supposed to go \u201d i still do  i\u2019m just like\u2026 the pressure on my people to express our identity and pride through the metaphor of party is very intense  don\u2019t get me wrong  i love the spectacle  i really do  but i\u2019ve never felt compelled to get amongst it  do you know  i\u2019m a quiet soul  my favorite sound in the whole world is the sound of a teacup finding its place on a saucer  oh  it\u2019s very  very difficult to flaunt that lifestyle in a parade  i don\u2019t even like the flag  controversial  but there  i\u2019ve said it  now\u2026 the pride flag  now  i love what it means  that is perfect  pride  wonderful  but the flag itself  bit busy  it\u2019s just six very shouty  assertive colors  stacked on top of each other  no rest for the eye  an afternoon of that waving in my face  i need to express my identity through the metaphor of a nap  i don\u2019t\u2026 i don\u2019t think i\u2019m very good at gay  i\u2019m not the only who thinks that  i\u2019ve\u2026 i\u2019ve been getting a bit of negative feedback of late from my people  the lesbians  bit of negative feedback  \u2018cause  gosh  don\u2019t my people love the feedback  not\u2026 not shy  not shy with the feedback  one of our spokespeople last year\u2026 self appointed  one of our spokespeople approached me straight after one of my shows to give me a bit of feedback  and that\u2019s my favorite time for feedback  straight after a show  yes  please  that is when my skin is at its thickest  the feedback  apparently  she said  \u201ci was very disappointed in your show this year  hannah  i just don\u2019t think there was enough lesbian content \u201d i\u2019d been on stage the whole time  i didn\u2019t\u2026 even straighten up halfway through  you know  perhaps i\u2019ve been slacking off a bit  when i first started\u2026 the comedy  over a decade ago  always  nothing but  nothing but lesbian content  wall to wall  my first ever show\u2026\u00a0 was classic new gay comic    my coming out story  i told lots of cool jokes about homophobia  really solved\u2026 that problem  tick  i told\u2026 a story about the time this young man had almost beaten me up because he thought\u2026 i mean  he thought i was cracking on to his girlfriend  actually  that bit was true  got that right  but\u2026  there was a twist  it happened late at night  it was at the bus stop  the pub had closed  it was the last bus home  and i was waiting at the bus stop  and i was talking to a girl  and\u2026 you know  you could say flirting  i don\u2019t know  and\u2026 out of nowhere  he just comes up and starts shoving me  going  \u201cfuck off  you fucking faggot \u201d and he goes  \u201ckeep away from my girlfriend  you fucking freak \u201d and she\u2019s just stepped in  going  \u201cwhoa  stop it  it\u2019s a girl \u201d and he\u2019s gone  \u201coh  sorry \u201d he said  \u201coh  i\u2019m so sorry  i don\u2019t hit women \u201d he said  what a guy  \u201ci don\u2019t hit women \u201d how about you don\u2019t hit anyone  good rule of thumb  and he goes  \u201csorry  i got confused  i thought you were a fucking faggot\u2026 trying to crack on to my girlfriend \u201d now i understand i have a responsibility to help lead people out of ignorance at every opportunity i can  but i left him there  people  safety first  the main part  the centerpiece  of that show  was coming out to my family  and particularly my mom  because my mom is very funny  she lives a comedy better than i can ever write it  her response to me coming out  when i told her i was a little bit lesbian\u2026 baby steps  her response\u2026 was this  she\u2019s just gone \u201doh  hannah  why did you have to tell me that  that\u2019s not something i need to know  i mean  what if i told you i was a murderer \u201d it\u2019s still funny  and it\u2019s a fair call  murderer  murderer  you would hope that\u2019s a phase  real jokes  but i reckon i\u2019ve been slacking off in recent years with my lesbian content  i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve been representing my people as much as i should be  you know  last year  my grandma asked me if i had a boyfriend  and i realized  in that moment  that i\u2019d\u2026 quite forgotten\u2026 to come out to grandma  i thought i\u2019d\u2026 i remember it being on my to do list  i thought  \u201ci\u2019ll wait till it comes up in conversation \u201d but it never does  but finally it did  but i did not take the opportunity  no  i deflected it like a real man  i said  \u201cno\u2026 no  grandma  no  i don\u2019t have time for boyfriends \u201d plural  confident  wasn\u2019t i  \u201cbut if i had time  heaps \u201d and she said  \u201cah  well  you never know  one day you might walk around the corner  and there he\u2019ll be \u201d \u201cmr  right \u201d she called him  and i have been approaching every corner with caution since then  no offense to mr  right  if you are out there  but you\u2019re also mr  very very too late  \u2018cause i\u2019ve done quite a lot of work on this lesbian situation here and i don\u2019t imagine i\u2019ve got a tight turning circle on identity  imagine the feedback  not enough lesbian content  do you know what i reckon my problem is  i don\u2019t lesbian enough  not in the scheme of my existence  not a lot  i mean  i keep my hand in  bit of lesbian content there  i\u2019ll be sprinkling it throughout the show  keep your feedback forms to yourselves  no  i mean  if you were to plot my week  i don\u2019t\u2026 not a lot  not a lot of lesbian ing\u2026 gets done  i cook dinner more  i cook dinner way more than i lesbian  but nobody every introduces me as \u201cthat chef comedian \u201d do they  not enough lesbian content  i should quit  i\u2019m a disgrace  what sort of comedian can\u2019t even make the lesbians laugh  every comedian ever  that\u2019s a good joke  isn\u2019t it  classic  it\u2019s bulletproof  too  very clever  because it\u2019s funny\u2026 because it\u2019s true  the only people who don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny\u2026 are us lezzers\u2026 but we\u2019ve got to laugh\u2026 because if we don\u2019t\u2026 proves the point  checkmate  very clever joke  i didn\u2019t write that  that is not my joke  it\u2019s an old\u2026\u00a0 an oldie  oldie but a goldie  a classic  it was written  you know  well before even women were funny  and back then  in the good old days  lesbian meant something different than it does now  back then  lesbian wasn\u2019t about sexuality  a lesbian was just any woman not laughing at a man  \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you laughing  what are you  some kind of lesbian \u201d classic  \u201cgo on  you gotta laugh  lighten up  stop taking everything so seriously  fucking learn to take a joke  you need to lighten up  i\u2019ll tell you what you need to lighten up  you need a good dicking  get a cock up you  drink some jizz  you know \u201d actual advice  it\u2019s counterproductive  i do think i have to quit comedy though  and seriously  i know it\u2019s probably not the forum\u2026 to make such an announcement  is it  in the middle of a comedy show  but i have been questioning\u2026 you know  this whole comedy thing  i don\u2019t feel very comfortable in it anymore  you know\u2026 over the past year  i\u2019ve been questioning it  and reassessing  and i think it\u2019s healthy for an adult human to take stock  pause and reassess  and when i first started doing the comedy  over a decade ago  my favorite comedian was bill cosby  there you go  it\u2019s very healthy to reassess  isn\u2019t it  and i built a career out of self deprecating humor  that\u2019s what i\u2019ve built my career on  and\u2026 i don\u2019t want to do that anymore  because  do you understand\u2026  audience applauds  \u2026do you understand what self deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins  it\u2019s not humility  it\u2019s humiliation  i put myself down in order to speak  in order to seek permission\u2026 to speak  and i simply will not do that anymore  not to myself or anybody who identifies with me   audience cheers  and if that means that my comedy career is over  then so be it  i got a letter\u2026 on facebook recently  and i say \u201cletter \u201d \u2019cause i\u2019m very bold  controversial  but i call it a letter  because it said  \u201cdear hannah \u201d comma  new line\u2026 bit of feedback  and it said  \u201cyou owe it to your community to come out as transgender \u201d all jokes aside  i really do want to do my best by my community  i really do  but that was new information to me  i\u2019m not\u2026 i don\u2019t identify as transgender  i don\u2019t  i mean  i\u2019m clearly \u201cgender not normal \u201d but\u2026 i don\u2019t think even lesbian is the right identity fit for me  i really don\u2019t  i may as well come out now  i identify\u2026 as tired  i\u2019m just tired  there is too much hysteria around gender from you gender normals  you\u2019re the weirdos  you\u2019re a bit fucking hysterical  you\u2019re a bit weird  a bit uptight  you need to get a grip  you gender normals\u2026 seriously  calm down  gender normals  get a grip  \u201cno  a man in a dress  that\u2019s fucking weird \u201d no  it\u2019s not  you know what\u2019s weird  pink headbands on bald babies  that\u2019s weird  i mean  seriously  would you put a bangle on a potato  no  that\u2019s organic  i paid a lot for that potato  of course i understand why parents do it  clearly they\u2019re sick and tired\u2026 of their beautiful baby girl\u2026 being mistaken for a boy baby because of the no hair situation  i understand that  but the thing is  i don\u2019t assume bald babies are boys  i assume they\u2019re angry feminists  and i treat them with respect  how about this  how about we stop separating the children into opposing teams from day dot  how about we give them  i dunno  seven to ten years to consider themselves\u2026 on the same side  did you know human men and human women have more in common\u2026 than they don\u2019t  did you know that  i don\u2019t think many people do know that because we always focus on the difference  the difference between men and women  they\u2019re very different  now  dogs are heaps different to\u2026 \u201cmen and women are very different  we\u2019re from different planets \u201d men are from mars  and women are for his penis  here\u2019s an idea  i say we get rid of pink and give all the babies blue  i\u2019ve thought about this and it\u2019s not because blue is a masculine color  \u2018cause that\u2026 is false  i love that people go  \u201cblue  yeah  a very masculine color  very reliable  very rational color  blue  yeah  you can trust blue  it\u2019s why we\u2019ve got it on flags  lot of blue on flags  navy blue  everyone trusts a boat \u201d blue  if anything  is a feminine color  it really is full of contradictions  you know  blue is a cold color  it\u2019s on the cold end of the spectrum  but the hottest part of the flame  blue  if you\u2019re feeling blue\u2026 you\u2019re sad  but optimism  blue skies ahead  make up your mind  a blueprint is a plan  but if something happens not on the plan  where does that come from  out of the blue  blue\u2019s a wonderful color to start life with  there\u2019s room for every kind of human in blue  there\u2019s a whole spectrum  \u2019cause blue doesn\u2019t demand\u2026 it doesn\u2019t demand action like all the other colors  think about this  you\u2019re stuck in traffic\u2026 and the lights turn\u2026 blue  less road rage  people  less road rage  more accidents  ironically enough  i get mistaken for a man quite a lot  but not for long  my masculinity doesn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny  i\u2019m only a man at a glance  which means it happens in a customer service situation  usually  because i\u2019m only a man at a glance  it means i\u2019m very much right there still  right in front of the person who\u2019s just called me \u201csir\u201d\u2026 and deeply regrets it  the really good ones just erase my memory of being called \u201csir \u201d they\u2019re clever  it\u2019s a clever trick  they do that with a combination\u2026 of hypnosis  and the magic word  they go  \u201ccan i help you  sir  madam \u201d and it works  gone  i do not remember being called \u201csir\u201d if someone calls me \u201cmadam\u201d immediately after  because \u201cmadam\u201d is a very triggering word for me  it is  it\u2019s what my mom used to call me when i was in a lot of trouble\u2026 for opening a brothel  can we just have more words  it\u2019s the apology i don\u2019t understand  when people apologize for mistaking me for a man  i got it on a flight recently  walking on  the cabin manager

apologize  don\u2019t apologize  look  i don\u2019t identify as transgender  but i\u2019m partial to a holiday  i love being mistaken for a man  \u2019cause just for a few moments  life gets a hell of a lot easier  i\u2019m top shelf normal  king of the humans  i\u2019m a straight white man  i\u2019m about\u2026 i\u2019m about to get good service for no fucking effort  do not apologize  i was going to take my assigned seat and both the armrests  your knee space  no \u201d just jokes  though  clearly\u2026 just jokes  just jokes  i wouldn\u2019t want to be a straight white man  not\u2026 right now  this is\u2026 not at this moment in history \u00a0it is not a good time to be a straight white man  i wouldn\u2019t want to be a straight white man  not if you paid me  although the pay would be substantially better  but  no\u2026 i don\u2019t think it\u2019s an easy time for you fellas  i do feel for you  very difficult  very confusing time  because\u2013 and you\u2019re not coping  because  for the first time ever  you\u2019re suddenly a sub category of human  right  \u201cno  we invented the categories  we\u2019re not supposed to play  we\u2019re human neutral \u201d not anymore  i\u2019ve always been judged by what i am  always been a fat  ugly dyke  i\u2019m dead inside  i can cope  but you fellas\u2026 bit soft in the belly  you hear \u201cstraight white man \u201d you\u2019re like  \u201cno  no  that\u2019s reverse sexism \u201d no  it\u2019s not  you wrote the rules  read them  just jokes  banter  don\u2019t feel intimidated  it\u2019s just locker room talk   audience cheers  just jokes  though  just jokes  do you know why i love\u00a0picking on  telling jokes about straight white men  \u2018cause they\u2019re such good sports  they\u2019re like  \u201coh  good joke about me  that\u2019s a refreshing perspective  if you hate men so much  why do you try so fucking hard to look like one \u201d \u2018cause you need a good role model right now  fellas   audience cheers  dropping like flies  jokes aside  if i may just give you a little human to human advice  because i do understand it is a difficult and confusing time for you now  you know  it\u2019s changing  it\u2019s shifting  and i understand that  but\u2026 may i just  you know  suggest that you learn to  sort of  move beyond your defensiveness  right  that\u2019s your first point  you\u2019re stuck on it  but you need to get some space around it  learn to develop\u2026 try and develop a sense of humor about it  or you need to lighten up  learn to laugh  tell you what might help  how about a good dicking  get a cock up ya  drink some jizz  you gotta laugh  that\u2019s weird advice  isn\u2019t it  it\u2019s weird  it doesn\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s not good  is it  it doesn\u2019t feel very nice  does it  laughter\u2019s the best medicine  they say  i don\u2019t  i reckon penicillin might give it the nudge  there is truth to it  though  laughter is very good for the human  it really is  \u2018cause when you laugh  you release tension  and when you hold tension in your human body  it\u2019s not healthy  it\u2019s not healthy psychologically or physically  that\u2019s why it\u2019s good to laugh  it\u2019s\u00a0even better to laugh with other people  when you laugh  in a room full of people  when you share a laugh  you will release more tension because laughter is infectious  you stand to release more tension when you laugh with other people than you would if you laugh alone  mainly because when you laugh alone  that\u2019s mental illness and that\u2019s a different kind of tension  laughter doesn\u2019t help  trust me  tension isolates us  and laughter connects us  good result  good on me  what a guy  what a guy  i\u2019m basically mother teresa  but just like mother teresa\u2026 my methods are not exactly charitable  let me explain to you what a joke is  and when you strip it back to its bare essential\u2026 components  like  its bare minimum  a joke is simply two things  it needs two things to work  a setup and a punch line  and it is essentially a question with a surprise answer  right  but in this context  what a joke is is a question that i have artificially inseminated  tension  i do that  that\u2019s my job  i make you all feel tense  and then i make you laugh  and you\u2019re like  \u201cthanks for that  i was feeling a bit tense \u201d i made you tense  this is an abusive relationship  do you know why i\u2019m such a funny fucker  do you  it\u2019s because  you know  i\u2019ve been learning the art of tension diffusion since i was a children  back then it wasn\u2019t a job  wasn\u2019t even a hobby  it was a survival tactic  i didn\u2019t have to invent the tension  i was the tension  and\u2026 i\u2019m tired of tension  tension is making me sick  it is time\u2026 i stopped\u2026 comedy  i have to quit comedy\u2026 but i mean\u2026 i can\u2019t quit you  no  i can\u2019t quit you  i can\u2019t  because i don\u2019t have a backup plan  guys  what have i got  fifteen years ago  i barely graduated from an art history degree  fifteen years ago  art history  fifteen\u2013 they were dead then  they\u2019re just deader  my cv is pretty much a cock and balls drawn under a fax number  could you imagine me working in a gallery with an asymmetrical woolen poncho with an aggressive\u2026 fringe  nasty jewelry  having the opinion  no  there\u2019s\u2026 you know  art history is highbrow  i don\u2019t belong in that world  i\u2019m not from that world  i\u2019m not from money  or even that much chat  if i\u2019m honest  but\u2026 high art  you know  that\u2019s what elevates and civilizes people  you know  galleries  the ballet  the the a ter  all these things  you go there  you get better  comedy  lowbrow  well  i\u2019m sorry to inform you  but nobody here is leaving this room a better person  we\u2019re just rolling around in our own shit here  people  but i\u2013 a couple of years ago  a man came up to me after\u2026 my show  he had an opinion  lesbians give feedback  men  opinions  now  in the show  i\u2019d spoken about taking antidepressant medication  and he had an opinion on that  now  interestingly  i\u2019d also spoken about how unhelpful unsolicited advice is in a\u2026 mental health plan  but he mustn\u2019t have heard that bit  he came up to me after the show to give me his opinion  he said  \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t take medication because you\u2019re an artist  it\u2019s important that you feel \u201d he said  \u201cif vincent van gogh had have taken medication  we wouldn\u2019t have the sunflowers \u201d i never  ever  ever thought that my art history degree would ever come in handy  but  oh  my lord  i tore that man a college debt sized new arsehole  i said  \u201cgood opinion  mate  except that he did medicate  a lot  he self medicated a lot  he drank a lot  he even nibbled on his own paints  problem  and also  you know what else  he didn\u2019t just paint sunflowers  he did quite a few portraits of psychiatrists  not even random ones  psychiatrists who were treating him  and medicating him  and there\u2019s one particular portrait of one particular psychiatrist  and he\u2019s holding a flower  and it isn\u2019t a sunflower  it\u2019s a foxglove  and that foxglove forms part of a medication that van gogh\u2026 took for epilepsy  and that derivative of the foxglove plant medi fucking cation\u2026\u201d i must have skipped a dose that day \u2019cause i was feeling  \u201cthe derivative of the foxglove  if you overdose it a bit  you know what happens  you can experience the color yellow a little too intensely  so perhaps\u2026 we have the sunflowers precisely because\u2026 van gogh medicated  what do you honestly think  mate \u201d i said  \u201cthat creativity means you must suffer  that is the burden of creativity  just so you can enjoy it  fuck you  mate  if you like sunflowers so much  buy a bunch and jerk off into a geranium \u201d know what he said  he goes  \u201cno need to be so sensitive \u201d i\u2019m not being sensitive  i\u2019m an artist  that\u2019s feeling  \u201cdon\u2019t be so sensitive \u201d that is the most common nugget of advice i get  \u2018cause i\u2019m a very sensitive person  and i get told to \u201cstop being so sensitive\u201d an awful lot  and it is always yelled  which i find very insensitive  i don\u2019t get it  \u201cstop being so sensitive \u201d i don\u2019t understand  why is insensitivity something to strive for  i happen to know that my sensitivity is my strength  i know that  it\u2019s my sensitivity that\u2019s helped me navigate a very difficult path in life  so when somebody tells me to \u201cstop being so sensitive \u201d you know what  i feel a little bit like a nose being lectured by a fart  not the problem  i feel like  in a comedy show  there\u2019s no room for the best part of the story\u2026 which is the ending  you know  in order to finish on a laugh  you know  you have to end\u2026 with punch lines  like  take my coming out story  for example  the best part of that story is the fact that mum and i have a wonderful relationship now  more than mother and daughter  we\u2019re friends  we trust each other  look what i did to the room  no tension  you\u2019re just going  \u201cgood on you  got a good relationship with your mum  have you  can you go back to the tension  that was hilarious \u201d but  yeah  mum said to me last year  she said  \u201ci\u2019m very proud\u2026 that i raised you kids without religion \u201d i\u2019d love to give you guys context on that  but that\u2019s not how my mum runs a conversation  i have no idea why she brought that up in target  no idea  she said  \u201ci\u2019m very proud that i raised you kids without religion because  you know  i\u2019ve raised five children with minds of their own \u201d and i\u2019ve just sort of gone  \u201cgood on you  what aren\u2019t you proud of  mum \u201d i was home for a week  we had time  because mum and i have established jokes around this difficult time in our life  we really do  the banter  if you will  i say things like  \u201cmum  you made my life very difficult \u201d and she\u2019ll go  \u201cyeah  well  i don\u2019t think i liked you very much \u201d and we laugh  \u2018cause you\u2019ve got to laugh  and\u2026 but not this day  she went quiet and\u2026 got tense  but what my mum eventually said to me is pretty much\u2026 at the core of why i\u2019m questioning\u2026 comedy  she said to me  \u201cthe thing i regret is that i raised you as if you were straight  i didn\u2019t know any different  i am so sorry  i\u2019m so sorry  i knew\u2026 well before you did\u2026 that your life was going to be so hard  i knew that  and i wanted it more than anything in the world not to be the case  and i know i made it worse  because i wanted you to change because i knew the world wouldn\u2019t \u201d and i looked at my mum in that moment and thought  \u201chow did that happen  how did my mum get to be the hero of my story \u201d she evolved  i didn\u2019t  see\u2026 i think part of my problem is comedy has suspended me in a perpetual state of adolescence  the way i\u2019ve been telling that story is through jokes  and stories\u2026 unlike jokes  need three parts  a beginning  a middle  and an end  jokes\u2026 only need two parts  a beginning and a middle  and what i had done  with that comedy show about coming out  was i froze an incredibly formative experience at its trauma point and i sealed it off into jokes  and that story became a routine  and through repetition  that joke version fused with my actual memory of what happened  but unfortunately that joke version was not nearly sophisticated enough to help me undo the damage done to me in reality  punch lines need trauma because punch lines\u2026 need tension  and tension feeds trauma  i didn\u2019t come out to my grandma last year because i\u2019m still ashamed of who i am  not intellectually  but  right there  i still have shame  you learn from the part of the story you focus on  i need to tell my story properly  because the closet  for me  was no easy thing\u2026 to come out of  from the years   to    right  this is ten years  effectively my adolescence  tasmania was at the center of a very toxic national debate about homosexuality and whether or not it should be legalized  and i\u2019m from the northwest coast of tasmania  the bible belt  seventy percent of the people\u2026 i lived amongst\u2026 believe that homosexuality should be\u2026 a criminal act  seventy percent of the people who raised me  who loved me  who i trusted  believed that homosexuality was a sin  that homosexuals were heinous  sub human pedophiles  seventy percent  by the time i identified as being gay  it was too late  i was already homophobic  and you do not get to just flick a switch on that  no  what you do is you internalize that homophobia and you learn to hate yourself  hate yourself to the core  i sat soaking in shame\u2026 in the closet  for ten years  because the closet can only stop you from being seen  it is not shame proof  when you soak a child in shame  they cannot develop the neurological pathways that carry thought\u2026 you know  carry thoughts of self worth  they can\u2019t do that  self hatred is only ever a seed planted from outside in  but when you do that to a child  it becomes a weed so thick  and it grows so fast  the child doesn\u2019t know any different  it becomes\u2026 as natural as gravity  when i came out of the closet  i didn\u2019t have any jokes  the only thing i knew how to do was to be invisible and hate myself  it took me ten years to understand i was allowed to take up space in the world  but  by then  i\u2019d sealed it off into jokes like it was no big deal  i need to tell my story properly  because i paid dearly for a lesson that nobody seems to have wanted to learn  and this is bigger\u2026 than homosexuality  this is about how we conduct debate in public about sensitive things  it\u2019s toxic  it\u2019s juvenile  it\u2019s destructive  we think it\u2019s more important to be right than it is to appeal to the humanity of people we disagree with  ignorance will always walk amongst us because we will never know all of the things  i need to tell my story properly because you learn from the part of the story\u2026 you focus on  take vincent  old mate\u2026 vincent van gogh  the way we tell his story\u2026 it\u2019s no good  it\u2019s destructive  because we\u2019ve reduced it to a tale of rags to riches  he only sold one painting in his life  you know  now look at him  \u201che\u2019s quite dead \u201d yeah  but very successful  only sold one painting in his lifetime  and people believe  with that story  that van gogh was this misunderstood genius  you know  he was born ahead of his time  what a load of shit  nobody is born ahead of their time  it\u2019s impossible  nobody\u2019s born ahead of their time  maybe premmie babies  but they catch up  artists don\u2019t invent zeitgeists  they respond to it  he was not ahead of his time  he was a post impressionist painter  painting at the peak of post impressionism  while peter was picking his pickled pepper  he wasn\u2019t born ahead of his time  he couldn\u2019t network  \u2018cause he was mental  he was\u2026 crazy  he had unstable energy  people would cross the street to avoid him  that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t sell any more than one painting in his lifetime  he couldn\u2019t network  this whole idea  this romanticizing of mental illness  is ridiculous  it is not a ticket to genius  it\u2019s a ticket to fucking nowhere  and artists are not these incredible  you know  mythical creatures that exist outside of the world  no  artists have always been very much part of the world  and very\u2026 very firmly attached to power  always  power and money  art is always there  right back to the renaissance  oh  the turtles  all of them  all of them  they knew how to network  leonardo  raphael  donatello  they\u2019re right up there  painting their own business cards  schmoozing  michelangelo was a bit difficult  he was a bit\u2026 crazy  but  you know  he still networked  he gave gobbies to the pope  kissed his ring  literally  but\u2026 i think it\u2019s a shame that art history is such an elitist sport  it taught me a lot  you know  useless\u2026 as far as a money earner\u2019s concerned  but i learned a lot about the world because of art history  i understand this world very well  i understand the world i live in\u2026 because of art history  i understand the world i live in and my place in it  and i don\u2019t have one  and do you know how much time that saved me  i\u2019m quite old  but look at the skin  that\u2019s \u2019cause i haven\u2019t wasted time looking\u2026 for how i fit in  i don\u2019t  a lot of naps  art history taught me there\u2019s only ever been two types of women  a virgin or a whore  most people think that miley cyrus and taylor swift invented that binary  but it\u2019s been going on thousands of years  there\u2019s only ever been two options for a little girl to grow up into  virgin or whore  we were always given a choice  take your pick  ladies\u2019 choice  that\u2019s the trick  the patriarchy  it\u2019s not a dictatorship  take your choice  and i don\u2019t fit very neatly into either of those categories  virgin or whore  i mean  on a technicality  i\u2019d get virgin  i know  do you know  if you go into a gallery with ye olde paintings there  there\u2019s a lot of evidence to suggest that women have existed for a very long time  longer than clothes  but not this masculine  off center  lesbian situation here  and i\u2026 art history taught me \u00a0you know  i look at these history women\u00a0and i don\u2019t feel like i\u2019m the same species  there\u2019s a lot of things that i do  and it\u2019s not an identity construction  no  i\u2019ve\u2026 just things happen naturally  and art history taught me that these things are not really the place of a woman  you know  one of the things i do  i can generate thoughts in my own brain\u2026 unprompted  i can do that  all the time  had another one  they just come all the time  and\u2026 art history taught me  you know  historically  women didn\u2019t have time for the think thoughts  they were too busy napping  naked  alone  in the forest  even biologically\u2026 i don\u2019t feel like i\u2019m the same species  for a start  i\u2019ve got a functioning skeletal system  if you go into the galleries  you see  if a woman\u2019s not sporting a corset and or a hymen\u2026 she just loses all structure  just sort of like\u2026 just flopping about all over the place  going  \u201coh  what does  furniture \u201d sidesaddle  tits akimbo  no wonder we can\u2019t reverse park  ladies  dumb history women couldn\u2019t even reverse park their arse onto a chair  another thing i do that\u2019s not very ladylike is every day i seem to be able to finish the getting of the dressed  every day  not a problem  all the buttons  all the way up  i\u2019m quite a vague and forgetful person  but\u2026 seem to do it quite easily  especially if i\u2019m leaving the house to get my portrait painted  never once have i thought  \u201cyou know what  today  i must just leave a cheeky one out \u201d high art  i\u2019m going to call it  guys  bullshit  high art  my arse  the history of western art is just the history of men painting women like they\u2019re flesh vases for their dick flowers  having\u2026 said that  i think i\u2019ve ruined any chance of getting a job in a gallery now  i mean  i could pay to be a volunteer guide  \u2018cause it doesn\u2019t get any better with modern art  i tell you  i trip on the first hurdle  pablo picasso  i hate him  but you\u2019re not allowed to  i hate him  but you can\u2019t  cubism  and if you ruin\u2026 cubism  then civilization as we know it will crumble  cubism  aren\u2019t we grateful\u2026 in this room\u2026 that we live in a post cubism world  isn\u2019t that the first thing we all write in our gratitude journals  \u201coh  thank god \u201d i don\u2019t like picasso  i fucking hate him  i really\u2013 i just\u2013 he\u2019s rotten in the face cavity  i hate picasso  i hate him  and you can\u2019t make me like\u2013 but you get it a lot  \u201coh  cubism\u2026\u201d and i know i should be more generous about him too because he suffered a mental illness  but you see  nobody knows that  because it doesn\u2019t fit with his mythology  they go  \u201ci think you\u2019re thinking of van gogh \u201d no  i\u2019m thinking about them all  actually\u2026 because picasso  he\u2019s sold to us as this passionate  virile  tormented genius  man  ball sack  right  there\u2019s no room in that story for\u2026 is there   audience member  no  no  it\u2019s rhetorical  but\u2026 there\u2019s a\u2026 but he did suffer a mental illness  picasso did  he suffered badly and it got worse as he got older  picasso suffered\u2026 the mental illness of misogyny  split the room  didn\u2019t i  and i bet you i know how that felt  is misogyny a mental illness  yeah  yeah  it is  especially if you\u2019re a heterosexual man  because if you hate what you desire  do you know what that is  fucking tense  sort your shit out  yeah  he did suffer from a mental illness  smarter men than i have proved he didn\u2019t suffer a mental illness  but they\u2019re\u2013 no  they\u2019re wrong  they\u2019d say he\u2019s not a misogynist  they\u2019re wrong  he was  if you don\u2019t believe me  let me provide you a quote from picky asshole himself  he said  \u201ceach time\u2026 i leave a woman  i should burn her  destroy the woman  you destroy the past she represents \u201d cool guy  the greatest artist of the twentieth century  let\u2019s make art great again  guys  picasso fucked an underage girl  and that\u2019s it for me  not interested  \u201cbut cubism\u2026 we need it \u201d marie th\u00e9r\u00e8se walter  she was   when they met  underage  legally underage  picasso was    married  at the height of his career  does it matter  yeah  yeah  it actually does  it does matter  but as picasso said  no  it was perfect  i was in my prime  she was in her prime  i probably read that when i was    do you know how grim that was  oh  i\u2019m in my prime  oh  there is no view at my peak  but i wasn\u2019t upset at the time  of course  because i was learning about cubism  now  i should qualify this  though  cubism is important  you know  it really is  it was a real game changer  picasso freed us from slavery  people  he really did  he freed us from the slavery of having to reproduce believable three dimensional reality on a two dimensional surface  three point perspective  that illusion that gives us the idea of a single stable world view  a single perspective  picasso said  \u201cno  run free  you can have all perspectives  that\u2019s what we need  from above  from below  inside out  the sides  all the perspectives at once \u201d thank you  picasso  what a guy  what a hero  thank you  but tell me  any of those perspectives a woman\u2019s  no  well  i\u2019m not fucking interested  you just put a kaleidoscope filter on your cock  you\u2019re still painting flesh vases for your dick flowers  separate the man from the art  that\u2019s what i keep hearing  you\u2019ve got to learn to separate the man from the art  the art is important  not the artist  you\u2019ve got to learn to separate the man from the art  yeah  all right  okay  let\u2019s give it a go  how about you take picasso\u2019s name off his little paintings and see how much his doodles are worth at auction  fucking nothing  nobody owns a circular lego nude  they own a picasso  sorry  you won\u2019t hear too many extended sets about art history in a comedy show  so\u2026 you\u2019re welcome  and it\u2019s bold  i know  comedy is more used to throwaway jokes about priests being pedophiles and trump grabbing the pussy  i don\u2019t have time for that shit  i don\u2019t  do you know who used to be an easy punch line  monica lewinsky  maybe  if comedians had done their job properly  and made fun of the man who abused his power  then perhaps we might have had a middle aged woman with an appropriate amount of experience in the white house  instead of  as we do  a man who openly admitted to sexually assaulting vulnerable young women because he could   audience cheers  do you know what should be the target of our jokes at the moment  our obsession with reputation  we\u2019re obsessed  we think reputation is more important than anything else  including humanity  and do you know who takes the mantle of this myopic adulation of reputation  celebrities  and comedians are not immune  they\u2019re all cut from the same cloth  donald trump  pablo picasso  harvey weinstein  bill cosby  woody allen  roman polanski  these men are not exceptions  they are the rule  and they are not individuals  they are our stories  and the moral of our story is  \u201cwe don\u2019t give a shit  we don\u2019t give a fuck\u2026 about women or children  we only care about a man\u2019s reputation \u201d what about his humanity  these men control our stories  and yet they have a diminishing connection to their own humanity  and we don\u2019t seem to mind so long as they get to hold onto their precious reputation  fuck reputation  hindsight is a gift  stop wasting my time  if you\u2026 look  i am angry  i apologize  i do  i apologize  i know\u2026 i know there\u2019s a few people in the room going  \u201cnow  look\u2026 i think\u2026 she\u2019s lost control of the tension \u201d that\u2019s correct  i went on it a bit there  so  i\u2019m not very experienced in controlling anger  it\u2019s not my place to be angry on a comedy stage  i\u2019m meant to be doing\u2026 self deprecating humor  people feel safer when men do the angry comedy  they\u2019re the kings of the genre  when i do it  i\u2019m a miserable lesbian  ruining all the fun and the banter  when men do it  heroes of free speech  i love\u2026 angry white man comedy  it\u2019s so funny  it\u2019s hilarious  they\u2019re adorable  why are they angry  what\u2019s up  little fella  what are they angry about  gosh  can\u2019t work it out  they\u2019re like the canaries in the mine  aren\u2019t they  if they\u2019re having a tough time\u2026 the rest of us are goners  do you remember that story\u00a0about that young man who almost beat me up  it was a very funny story  it was very funny  i made a lot of people laugh about his ignorance  and the reason i could do that is because i\u2019m very good at this job  i actually am pretty good at controlling the tension  and i know how to balance that to get the laugh at the right place  but in order to balance the tension in the room with that story  i couldn\u2019t tell that story as it actually happened  because i couldn\u2019t tell the part of the story where that man realized his mistake  and he came back  and he said  \u201coh  no  i get it  you\u2019re a lady faggot  i\u2019m allowed to beat the shit out of you \u201d and he did  he beat the shit out of me and nobody stopped him  and i didn\u2019t\u2026 report that to the police  and i did not take myself to hospital  and i should have  and you know why i didn\u2019t  it\u2019s because i thought that was all i was worth  and that is what happens when you soak one child in shame and give permission to another to hate  and that was not homophobia  pure and simple  people  that was gendered  if i\u2019d been feminine  that would not have happened  i am incorrectly female  i am incorrect  and that is a punishable offense  and this tension  it\u2019s yours  i am not helping you anymore  you need to learn what this feels like because this\u2026 this tension is what not normals carry inside of them all of the time because it is dangerous to be different  to the men\u2026 to the men in the room  i speak to you now  particularly the white men  especially the straight white men  pull your fucking socks up  how humiliating  fashion advice from a lesbian  that is your last joke  all my life  i\u2019ve been told that i\u2019m a man hater  i don\u2019t hate men  i honestly do not  i don\u2019t hate men  but\u2026 there\u2019s a problem  see  i don\u2019t even believe that women are better than men  i believe women are just as corruptible by power as men  because you know what  fellas  you don\u2019t have a monopoly on the human condition  you arrogant fucks  but the story is as you have told it  power belongs to you  and if you can\u2019t handle criticism  take a joke  or deal with your own tension without violence  you have to wonder if you are up to the task of being in charge  i\u2019m not a man hater  but i\u2019m afraid of men  if i\u2019m the only woman in a room full of men  i am afraid  and if you think that\u2019s unusual  you\u2019re not speaking to the women in your life  i don\u2019t hate men  but i wonder how a man would feel if they\u2019d lived my life  because it was a man who sexually abused me when i was a child  it was a man who beat the shit out of me when i was    my prime  it was two men who raped me when i was barely in my twenties  tell me why is that okay  why was it okay to pick me off the pack like that and do that to me  it would have been more humane to just take me out to the back paddock and put a bullet in my head if it is that much of a crime to be different  i don\u2019t tell you this\u2026 so you think of me as a victim  i am not a victim  i tell you this because my story has value  my story has value  i tell you this \u2019cause i want you to know  i need you to know  what i know  to be rendered powerless does not destroy your humanity  your resilience is your humanity  the only people who lose their humanity are those who believe they have the right to render another human being powerless  they are the weak  to yield and not break  that is incredible strength  you destroy the woman  you destroy the past she represents  i will not allow my story\u2026 to be destroyed  what i would have done to have heard a story like mine  not for blame  not for reputation  not for money  not for power  but to feel less alone  to feel connected  i want my story\u2026 heard  because  ironically  i believe picasso was right  i believe we could paint a better world if we learned how to see it from all perspectives  as many perspectives as we possibly could  because diversity is strength  difference is a teacher  fear difference  you learn nothing  picasso\u2019s mistake was his arrogance  he assumed he could represent all of the perspectives  and our mistake was to invalidate the perspective of a   year old girl  because we believed her potential\u2026 was never going to equal his  hindsight is a gift  can you stop wasting my time  a   year old girl is just never  ever  ever in her prime  ever  i am in my prime  would you test your strength out on me   audience applauds  there is no way anyone would dare\u2026 test their strength out on me  because you all know\u2026 there is nothing stronger then a broken woman who has rebuilt herself   audience cheers  to the men in the room\u2026 who feel i may have been persecuting you this evening\u2026 well spotted  that\u2019s pretty much what i\u2019ve done there  but this is theater  fellas  i\u2019ve given you an hour  a taste  i have lived a life  the damage done to me is real and debilitating  i will never flourish  but this is why\u2026 i must quit comedy  because the only way\u2026 i can tell my truth\u00a0and put tension in the room is with anger  and i am angry  and i believe i\u2019ve got every right to be angry  but what i don\u2019t have a right to do is to spread anger  i don\u2019t  because anger  much like laughter  can connect a room full of strangers like nothing else  but anger  even if it\u2019s connected to laughter  will not\u2026 relieve tension  because anger is a tension  it is a toxic  infectious\u2026 tension  and it knows no other purpose than to spread blind hatred  and i want no part of it  because i take my freedom of speech as a responsibility  and just because i can position myself as a victim  does not make my anger constructive  it never is constructive  laughter is not our medicine  stories hold our cure  laughter is just the honey that sweetens the bitter medicine  i don\u2019t want to unite you with laughter or anger  i just needed my story heard  my story felt and understood by individuals with minds of their own  because  like it or not  your story\u2026 is my story  and my story\u2026 is your story  i just don\u2019t have the strength to take care of my story anymore  i don\u2019t want my story defined by anger  all i can ask is just please help me take care of my story  do you know why we have the sunflowers  it\u2019s not because vincent van gogh suffered  it\u2019s because vincent van gogh had a brother who loved him  through all the pain  he had a tether  a connection to the world  and that\u2026 is the focus of the story we need  connection  thank you   audience cheers   \u201ca better son daughter\u201d by rilo kiley plays \n\u266a then you hang up the

\u2018stand up\u2019 routine called \u201cnanette\u201d  if you can call it \u2018stand up\u2019 is propaganda promoting her own agenda to make a quick buck  i understand homophobia is rampant and we should really do something about it  but censoring ourselves is really just masking the problem  as a collective human race we need to stand together unified  not labeling ourselves and then getting mad when those labels bring assumptions  if you told me you were a girl  i would assume you need tampons  turns out you\u2019re transgender and get offended because i didn\u2019t know  so what am i supposed to do  ask everyone what their acceptable vocabulary is  no i hardly think so  does this mean we need to punish speaking your mind when someone takes offense  certainly not  what we need to do is spend more time helping our children be the people we couldn\u2019t  and less time worrying what others think about you  you can\u2019t be popular with everyone  i also very much do not appreciate the veil it\u2019s being marketed as \u201ca netflix comedy special\u201d sure she is standing up on stage  sure she says some jokes  however the main portion of the routine was talking about how hard it is to live with mental illness and gender queerness  it is a look at the current environment of our society  but it\u2019s under the wrong image  and sending the wrong message  all this made me do is come out wondering how much damage she could be pushing forward  it\u2019s baffling that all eric got from this is that  you must be a very cold and calculated person  probably thinking your \u201clogic\u201d makes you seem intelligent  you use the word damage as though the message was anything other than a pure and emotional telling of her life and the thoughts she\u2019s come to because of the career she\u2019s in  the subjects she studied and who she is  what she\u2019s experiences and how it all relates  christianity brands itself as being primarily about jesus\u2019s love of every living person  that\u2019s what ropes people in  the message of love and acceptance  then as you get into it  you learn it\u2019s about a hell of a lot more than simply that  warts and all  she\u2019s been making a career as a comedian  therefore it would be branded a comedy special  anything goes  you are not entitled to her censoring herself because she felt compelled to reveal more than a simple formulaic comedy routine  just because someone has a message  doesn\u2019t make it propaganda  if that is the case  everything anyone says is pushing propaganda  does that mean no one should speak  for fear of pushing their propaganda   she had a truly powerful and positive message  and was damn funny as well  dave chappelle with a thin veil  pushed \u201cpropaganda\u201d that it\u2019s actually okay that bill cosby raped ten\u2019s of women but that it was okay because he also was philanthropic  please let me see your biting commentary on how wrong that was  i won\u2019t even delve into how ludicrous and uninformed the rest of your \u201copinion\u201d is  because it likely would not even permeate  \u201cas a collective human race we need to stand together unified  not labeling ourselves and then getting mad when those labels bring assumptions \u201d    you clearly don\u2019t practice what you preach because standing together would mean accepting all the perspectives  you don\u2019t accept what hannah has said  so what you want is assimilation not unification     you don\u2019t want labels  i\u2019m going to make an educated guess here that you have never had to use labels been labelled  labelling begins with those in power  it sets up the norm  the normal  and then everything not normal  there is an inherent subjugation that happens where one label retains power by labelling something or someone as other  when the other embraces their labels  it destabilizes the power the original labeller has     you understand homophobia is rampant  well gee  eric  let\u2019s call of the gay rights movement everyone  eric reckons he understands it  our work is done     most people don\u2019t mind if you ask  politely  sorry what are your pronouns  in fact  a lot of cisgender people  that means not transgender  our gender reflects our sex assigned at birth  have got into the habit of drawing attention to their own pronouns so that trans people don\u2019t feel singled out     do you just go up to girls women and throw tampons at them  i think women with uteruses would be pissed off creeped out by some random guy\u2019s interest in their menstrual cycle  so yeah  they would find you offensive      comedy often has a serious message tied through it  not everyone likes that kind of comedy  as such  don\u2019t watch don\u2019t rewatch  if a man had made points like hannah about mental illnesses and gender in society he would have been applauded  the discomfort is that hannah speaks from experience  as a minority  and you feel as if you were tricked into watching  funnily enough  i believe netflix allows you to turn off a programme at any point     i\u2019m not sure your concern about potential harm comes from the right place  it certainly doesn\u2019t come from an informed place  many people who have experiences like hannah\u2019s gain strength from learning they are not alone  that their story is shared and so they\u2019re not the only singled out person picked on by cruel people  what you seem to be suggesting is a need for trigger warnings which contradicts what you\u2019ve written about concerns regarding censorship   to conclude  maybe this wasn\u2019t for you  don\u2019t be so sensitive and go watch something else  i completely agree with eric  he has a very valid point  after the stand up was published on netflix  my grandma saw it  and told me she has no problem with me being gay  in fact she prefers gay cuz her husband  i e  my grandpa  was a cheating bastard  i thought everyone was against me when in fact they had no problems with my identity at all  i am a fraud  but nonetheless a rich fraud  not all biologically female people need tampons by the way  some women don\u2019t get their period because of medication  a condition  or menopause  not to mention women who don\u2019t like tampons   just remember  opinion is not the same thing as fact  eric  this is comedy  i thought amy schumer and carlos mencia set the bar for entry low  but at least they still told jokes  this is closer to a tedx talk than anything resembling stand up  thank you so much for that transcript  a pity that especially some men do not get the message  she really made a difference for thousands of people  thanks for sharing the transcript  such an extraordinary and articulate piece of theatre  is it stand up  possibly not  but i think that\u2019s possibly not the right question  thank you so much for posting this transcript  there are certain lines and points  especially at the end that are so necessary to read in order to analyze \nin terms of the points made by various folks here in these comments as well as the virtual void of media critique as a whole  i think this is for sure a stand up comedy special and my only critique of hannah\u2019s performance is the sort of pushing comedy away or codifying comedy as insufficient in dealing with the trauma and oppression she\u2019s addressing  i think for as profound a special and piece of writing performance as this is  i wish very much she and others considered it comedy  if not it would almost certainly than be sermon  and none of us want to admit we so desperately crave a just and equal religion in our lives do we  i guess i just believe so wholeheartedly in the power of the comedic art form  much as hannah describes herself in her early career feeling  that adding the third dimension to the set up punchline dynamic doesnt make this not comedy  it just makes it a more expansive form of comedy  perhaps a more fluid and spectrum based comedy  much like the gender perspectives she addressed as well  i have always thought of poetry as stand up tragedy  so she sort of blended them \ni think it was sav above who commented about chapelle\u2019s special where he made the cosby jokes  that bit of his special was poorly executed  the whole \u201che rapes but he saves\u201d schtick  it was the weakest part of all four specials  but the one kernel in it i valued and respected  as it profoundly affected my childhood too  was just how hopeful and philanthropic and inspiring cosby was and portrayed himself to be to lower class and minority kids and families  the huxtables and the students on a different world were characters that meant so much to me and my developing world view that coming to grips with the loss and deception and abuse of that power is traumatic  should chapelle have used his comedic prowess to connect those feelings of loss  deception  and trauma with the victims of cosby\u2019s assualt and with toxic masculinity as a whole  yeah probably  were his jokes about it weak and unfunny  yeah undoubtedly  was it still comedy  absolutely  and nanette  ultimately is still comedy too  arguably  better constructed and more dimensional comedy  chapelle in a later special  in a smaller more intimate club where i think he is better suited  talked about the importance of not being right so much as starting conversation  of speaking recklessly  speaking provacatively  hannah gadsby\u2019s show is certainly provactive  some of the anger she uses she even admits is reckless  but it is all a part of the stand up comedy  i just wish and hope that it is considered as such  especially by its creator  because we need a more expansive view of storytelling in comedy these days  hannah gadsby  it\u2019s     and i feel you touched and disturbed something very sensitive in my male world \ni began laughing and  loved your comedy   then i wasn\u2019t  i was uncomfortable at the truths you began to speak about men and power and privilege \ni\u2019d marched in the   for peace  i went to protests  love ins  painted peace signs everwhere and on everything  smoked joints and loved everyone  i was a child of the liove ins and freedom marches  \u201cthe times were a\u2019changin\u2019    i also loved the mini dress  and thought bra burning a bit extreme to get your point across \ni had grown up working in the   where i accepted as normal that women were paid less for doing the same work  and you reminded me of that ignorance of equality while marching against injustice  another little uncorfirtable sqirm in my seat\ni\u2019d hanged with the times  through the      etc  i thought of myself as a liberal minded man  and yet  here i was  slightly uncomfortable \u2013 again \u2013 as i i thought thst we were in a society addressing your grievances in the courts and public debates on abc  sbs  wli watch \u201cyou can\u2019t ask that\u201d   yet i watched you getting angrier  talking about ending your comedy path \nprior to retiring at   i had female heads of departments  i\u2019d raised   children  the   girls either lecturing at uni  teaching or running their own businesses  come on  hannah  i was never homophobic  i worked in the   on a metro newspaper and lived in kings cross  \u201csome if my best friends\u2026  \u201d\n i marched so my youngest son could marry his partner  even had my yes badges proudly displayed in brisbane streets and nudes \nso how am i still feeling like the bad guy  yet this nagging feeling persisted as you then began to recount your own journey of horrors  i\u2019ve never ever sat in a room of women or girls and felt unsafe  i know we\u2019ve survived when sexual abuse visited our family  yet still this nagging feeling that your hurt and self loathing were vocalised and visualised on stage generated that ongoing tension  when would the joke break the tension  it didn\u2019t come and left me in a world where i have to tweek my reality again  to empathise not just family with anxiety and depression but now with the other half of society who are flexing their rights more assertively  because they should  thank you for a wonderful show  i hope you continue to advocate in your own way and  most importantly  be happy with who you\u2019ve become eric brother\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026   amen i have probably watched this five times and it\u2019s still devastating every single time  hannah speaks so much truth  truths like  \u201cwhen you soak a child in shame  they cannot develop the neurological pathways that carry thoughts of self worth \u201d this rings so true for me as a gay man who grew up having to hide in plain sight in a conservative christian home  i learned to see myself as broken  unworthy  unacceptable\u2026 not normal  so many of us had shame hardwired into the very core of our being  one of my favorite quotes that\u2019s become my mantra is  \u201cyour resilience is your humanity \u201d that is a realization that so many of us not normals have had to struggle and fight to see  especially when the world keeps telling us that we\u2019re wrong  and that\u2019s one of the most incredible things about this show  hannah manages to  as she says  provide a glimpse of what the not normal experience is like  at the same time it feels like she\u2019s speaking directly to all the other not normals  putting into words what we\u2019ve known but never quite had the words to say  and helping us feel less alone by sharing her story  to digress slightly  some of the comments left here by several of the men who felt the need to grace us with their opinions reminded me of a phrase that\u2019s been coming to mind while looking at the current state of our world  \u201cmen without chests \u201d it\u2019s a phrase from c  s  lewis that describes those who have severed their intellect from their humanity  i\u2019ve heard  and known  so many men who consider themselves to be \u201clogical\u201d and rational  they revel in pointing out all the ways someone is wrong and their ability to stay above emotion and sentiment  it\u2019s a virtue  their world is black and white  where they\u2019re always right  and where the dignity and feelings of others are irrelevant  there is so much wisdom and truth in what hannah has to say and it\u2019s a shame that these men have shut their ears to it  it doesn\u2019t matter if nanette isn\u2019t peppered with jokes or that hannah isn\u2019t funny all the way through  although the \u201cfashion advice from a lesbian\u201d line is the best   it transcended comedy  in my estimation  the world shifted when hannah walked on stage  i\u2019m   years old   my family were in midwest vaudeville and i had a union card as a performer by age     that gives me   years of theatrical experience  because i never stopped performing even though i have three degrees and am still working a day job as a scientist in a technical field   and i\u2019m straight  all that said  i have never read anything that spoke to me so clearly of my own pain  experience  and anger   i don\u2019t care what the hell you call what you do  just keep doing it  the world is now a better place  i was watching this while trying to figure out a topic for an assignment  as i watched this i decided to make my topic \u2018being different is dangerous\u2019  it moved me  i had watched it ages ago and decided to re watch it while working  it has always and always will be one of my favourites because i love comedy but i love hearing about peoples lives more  i love talking about what is wrong with the world  i am not alone\u2026 for those saying this is not comedy i want to ask do you consider waiting for godot not theater  the best way i have ever heard someone describe a master of their craft is when they know the rules so well they then know how to break them  this is what i believe hannah gadsby did  she is a master of her craft who broke the rules of comedy  will this come off as \u201cnot comedy\u201d to some  yes  but that\u2019s the fucking point  and to those saying it\u2019s propaganda or agenda seeking content it just makes me think of the words of my favorite author terry pratchett when he said \u201csatire is meant to ridicule power  if you are laughing at people who are hurting  it\u2019s not satire  it\u2019s bullying \u201d  hannah gadsby turned comedy inside out in this piece to show not only the truth of satire that mainstream media has taken  i e  bullying the weak  but also how that culture bled into her own work  i e  bullying herself   quick correction  the song that plays at the end of the stand

\u201d there are all these rules about pregnancy that are unsaid  where is it written that when you\u2019re\u00a0pregnant  you have\u00a0to cup your little bump in every picture  it\u2019s so obnoxious  guys  every picture  here\u2026 it\u2019s all right  some people do the two hand  i was like  okay  fuck it  i\u2019ll do it  but i\u2019m going to do it for the rest of my life  i\u2019m going to be   years old like this  with a cigarette\u00a0in my mouth like\u2026 i do it  i cup the bump\u2026 in pictures  but i just do it a little bit lower  i just go right here  \u2018cause this is the area that got me in trouble in the first place  all the questions everyone\u2026 \u201cwhat are\u00a0you having  do you know what you\u2019re having \u201d hemorrhoids  any other questions  why do they ask  \u201cwhat are you craving  what are you craving  are you craving anything \u201d cock  just me and my angel  people always want to see the bump  that\u2019s like the thing  \u201cjust show me that\u00a0fucking bump  bitch \u201d and my belly button is getting so misshapen with this baby inside that i\u00a0had to put two band aids over my belly\u00a0button tonight  that\u2019s more than you bargained for  right  somebody\u2019s neglecting their bikini area  i\u2026 i\u2019ll tell you who it\u2019s not fun to be pregnant at the exact same time as  meghan markle  i think we\u2019re  like  to the day the same amount pregnant  and she\u2019s out there in  like  six inch heels  adorable outfits  and she has like\u2026 there\u2019s been no bump  like  there\u2019s been\u2026 she  like  cups where the bump will be  you know \u00a0she\u2019s like\u2026 \u201chere  here\u2019s where the baby will be \u201d people see me  they\u2019re like  \u201cthe last couple of weeks are the hardest  right  are you crowning  i think i can see an ear  is that an ear \u201d if i were meghan markle\u2026 and i am\u2026 \u2018cause she hangs out with the queen now  like  they hang out and have conversations  if i were meghan  no matter what the queen\u00a0asked me  and i can\u2019t do a great\u00a0british accent  but  you know  if she said something like  \u201cla  la  la  oh  pip pip  would you like a spot of lemon \u201d like probably exactly that  she probably says  no matter what  if i were meghan  i would\u00a0answer everything she asks with  \u201cyas  queen  yas \u201d i just came so close to shitting myself  you guys don\u2019t\u2026 this special almost became a real\u00a0special  that would have\u2026 what would i have done  kind of just kicked it  and\u2026 trusted that you guys would be cool  is that what i would have done  i have not had an easy pregnancy  i have hyperemesis  which i\u2019d never even\u00a0heard of  it\u2019s extreme nausea and vomiting  if you\u2019ve ever had food poisoning  it\u2019s that  i\u2019ve had that every day for five months  no  and people are like  \u201cyou\u2019re so strong  look\u00a0at you out there  you\u2019re on the road \u201d i\u2019m contractually obligated to be out here  guys  i\u2019m not like  \u201ci don\u2019t care  the show must\u00a0go on \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201ci will be sued by live nation \u201d that\u2019s why i\u2019m here  but i feel pretty good tonight  to be honest with you  so\u2026 i didn\u2019t throw up today  uh\u2026 yeah  but i didn\u2019t know that being pregnant could be really hard  like\u2026 i didn\u2019t know that because you\u00a0bitches all lie about it  women don\u2019t tell you how hard it is  i should have googled it  i should have googled being pregnant  \u2018cause it\u2019s been really awful  \u2018cause in movies  they don\u2019t show you  there\u2019s just a montage where the girl\u2019s in her office and she\u2019s typing  and then\u00a0she\u2019s like\u2026 and she runs to the bathroom  she throws up once  and then in the next scene  she\u2019s in overalls painting a barn  like  \u201cyay \u201d \u266a i can\u2019t wait to meet you \u266a you know  i throw up an exorcist amount every day  and i feel like  you know  if you had\u00a0a good pregnancy  if you\u2019re someone who enjoyed being pregnant  i just hope\u00a0your car flips over  that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what i wish for you  your car kind of chappaquiddicks into a\u00a0lake  and you just kinda\u2026 \u2026slowly\u2026 drown  is that fair to say  because here\u2019s the thing  you\u2019re pregnant  but you don\u2019t change  i hate women who start to act really just precious and like  \u201cyes  now i\u2019m\u2026 i\u2019m a saint  and i never\u2026 i never had sex in a bathroom on a train \u201d you know  we\u2019ve all had sex in the bathroom on a\u00a0train  you don\u2019t stop being you  you know  you don\u2019t stop working or drinking  like  you\u2026 you know  i\u2019ve gotten in the habit of asking  uh  friends\u2019 recommendations and advice about pregnancy until i get the answer i\u00a0want  you know what i mean  i asked my most responsible\u00a0friend  she\u2019s a nurse  i was like  \u201cso  wine\u2026 what do you think  should i just have\u00a0some  or what\u00a0do you think  while i\u2019m pregnant  wine  definitely have some  or what do you think \u201d and\u2026 and she was like  \u201cyou know what  just skip\u00a0it  just be safe  you know \u201d and\u00a0i was like  \u201cyes  that\u2019s what i thought  but i wanted to hear you say it  so now i\u2019ll tell other people not to drink ever while they\u2019re pregnant  thank you \u201d huh  good  that\u2019s done with  and then\u2026 you know  and then i asked  like  a little more lenient of a friend  i\u2019m like\u2026 \u201chey  what are your thoughts on drinking wine while you\u2019re pregnant \u201d she\u2019s like  \u201ca glass a week is fine  like  that\u2019s probably fine \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cthat\u2019s better  that makes sense \u00a0that\u2019s good  you\u2019re smart \u201d and then\u2026 then you ask your kind of biggest dirtbag  deadbeat friend  you know  she\u2019s like  \u201conce you start getting  like  fucked up  stop drinking \u201d i\u2019m like\u2026 mm hmm  no  i haven\u2019t even wanted\u2026 wine  that\u2019s how i know this baby is not mine  this baby is a lie  no  it\u2019s mine  and\u2026 i\u2019m pretty sure the guy\u00a0who got me pregnant is my husband \u2019cause i got married  yay  \u266a to the luckiest boy in the world \u266a i married a chef because i\u2019m a fucking\u00a0genius  right  do you guys like food  that\u2019s what he makes  yeah  i love it  marrying a chef  it\u2019s like a little on the nose for me  it\u2019s kind of like snoop marrying weed  i love him  it\u2019s real  um\u2026 the proposal was wack  uh\u2026 he proposed to me in the morning  that\u2019s  like  when people in a nursing home\u00a0get engaged  like\u2026 not  like  at sunrise  i was still asleep  i was sleeping  and i sleep like i\u2019m still\u00a0in the womb  earplugs  eye mask\u2026 my mom\u2019s legs around my shoulders  like\u2026 you know  recreate  every morning  i\u2019m born and\u2026 so i\u2019m\u2026 in the womb  and he comes in  and i just took one ear plug out  i was like\u2026 and he kind of threw the ring box\u00a0at me  and he goes  \u201ci got you this \u201d and i open it  and\u2026 and he goes  \u201cdo you want me to get down on one\u00a0knee \u201d and i was like  \u201ci guess not \u201d and then i went back to sleep  that\u2019s the truth \u00a0that\u2019s a real ass proposal  though  that\u2019s like a real\u2026 you know  \u2018cause  like  in movies and tv shows  the guy\u00a0always gets down on one knee  right  and the girl\u2019s always shocked  \u201ci didn\u2019t even know you liked me  i\u2019m still on bumble  like  this is\u2026\u201d like  you didn\u2019t talk about\u2026 that\u2019s a very\u00a0big decision\u2026 to not talk about  i don\u2019t know any\u00a0girl who got engaged that way  i\u2019m from new york  all my girlfriends are from new york  we get married late there  when you\u00a0get engaged at    it\u2019s like  \u201cwhoa  teen bride  like  slow\u2026 slow it down  get to know him \u201d i think there are only two reasons you should get down on one knee if you\u2019re a guy  if you\u2019re a player in the nfl\u2026 and to eat my pussy  those are the two\u2026 two reasons  i mean  if the guy you\u2019re with gets  like  synchronized swans to dance\u00a0to bruno mars  you\u00a0know  he\u2019s gay  that\u2019s a gay guy  and  look  we all have a friend married to a\u00a0gay guy  we do  we do \u00a0you\u2019re probably here with a couple right now  and they\u2019re like  \u201ctalk about meghan markle more \u201d we\u2019ve had that experience  right  when you meet the couple for the first time  and then they leave  and then a couple of your friends  you\u2019re taking each other\u2019s\u00a0temperature  you\u2019re like\u2026 \u201cjeff was nice  right \u201d \u201cyeah  yeah  jeff was cool  yeah \u201d \u201cyou said he\u2019s a costume designer  he\u2019s a\u2026 yeah \u201d and then finally someone\u2019s like  \u201cis jeff gay \u201d you\u2019re like  \u201cjeff is gay  yes \u201d and we all laugh at our friend  \u201chee hee  she\u2019s married to a gay guy \u201d but you know\u00a0what  someone with hyperemesis who\u2019s five months\u00a0pregnant  you know who sounds like it would be fun to be married to right now  fucking jeff  get on one knee for jeff  i think\u2026 i don\u2019t want to jinx it  i think i don\u2019t have to be a bridesmaid anymore  yeah  i think i\u2019ve done\u2026 i\u2019m not making no new friends  everybody got married  i was the last one  \u2018cause when you get in your late\u00a0   there\u2019s just no dignity to it \u00a0you know  it\u2019s like me in a grecian gown with my aging cleavage and like\u2026 a coachella flower halo  i\u2019m just like\u2026 just hoping i\u2019m not the bridesmaid with the biggest arm  you know  i\u2019m like\u2026 i hold my arm out  \u2018cause people used to get married in their early    you had a little   year old bridesmaid\u00a0arm  you were\u00a0holding your champagne\u00a0like  \u201cit\u2019s heavy \u201d now it\u2019s just a sea of turkey legs  just\u2026 looks like the defensive line for the bears are in the wedding  i really respect you guys for coming out because if you follow me on instagram  you\u2019re probably like  \u201cis this bitch in the\u00a0hospital  is she gonna be there \u201d yeah  i made it  i\u2026 i\u2019ve been hospitalized a couple of times since i\u2019ve been pregnant with hyperemesis and\u2026 the very first time was about a month ago \u00a0and\u2026 i was throwing up for about five hours when i\u2026 was taken to the hospital  the doctor came in  and he explained to me and my sister and my husband  who were are all\u00a0in the room  he said  \u201cyou\u2019re going to be here for at least five\u00a0hours getting liquids \u201d and without\u00a0skipping a beat  my husband\u00a0said to my sister  \u201cokay  cool  because i saw a place where you\u00a0can paint pottery nearby \u201d you guys are like  \u201cis he gay \u201d so my sister didn\u2019t even \u00a0like  check in with me if it was cool that they left me  as soon\u00a0as he said \u201cpottery \u201d they just left  and i was like  \u201ci\u2019ll be here \u201d and about an hour and a half later  my sister rushed back in the room  and she\u00a0said  \u201cokay  listen  be nice to him about\u00a0what he painted \u201d i\u2019m like\u2026 \u201cokay \u201d she\u2019s like  \u201ci\u2019m serious  he worked really hard on it \u201d \u201cokay \u201d she goes\u2026 \u201cand it\u2019s not very flattering \u201d i\u2019m like  \u201cwhat \u201d but my husband\u2019s brain is a little different  \u2018cause you go to these places  you usually\u00a0paint a teddy bear or a jewelry box  you\u00a0know  but my husband decided to\u2026 to paint a plate\u2026 which he would use as a canvas\u2026 to paint me  and i\u2019m going to show you the picture  i think it\u2019s important for you guys\u00a0to see the picture  um\u2026 and i want to show you this  and i\u00a0want you to know that there were no qualifiers before he showed me this picture  he was sure it was pretty good  this is the picture that he painted  i was in the hospital  guys  what is\u2026 i wanted to go  \u201cwhat\u2019s with my chin on my\u00a0neck \u201d i look like trump  like  i look\u2026 i couldn\u2019t say any of this to him  okay  get rid of it  people are leaving  this is upsetting  this is an upsetting image  i mean\u2026 i had to comfort him  my husband is a really great sport  you know  he really is  i keep messing\u00a0with him  like  you know  i\u2019ve had a tough pregnancy  so\u2026 the other day  i was like  \u201cbabe  this is kind of too hard for me  i don\u2019t think i can do it \u201d and he\u2019s like  \u201cwhat do you mean \u201d and i was like\u2026 \u201cwhat do you think i mean  i think i\u2026 i need to get an abortion \u201d and this was his response  he went\u2026 \u201creally \u201d i was like  \u201cno  what \u201d i\u2019m going to announce it on instagram  and then i\u2019m going to be like  \u201cactually  forget it  i don\u2019t like it  i\u2019m tired  i don\u2019t like it \u201d thank god that was his response  you know  what if he\u2019d been like  \u201ccool  i\u2019ll warm up\u00a0the car \u201d i knew from the beginning that my husband\u2019s brain was a little different\u00a0than mine  um  and about\u2026 i have to start this over \u2019cause i really want to get this right  because i love him very much  and\u2026 my husband was diagnosed with what used to be called asperger\u2019s  he has autism\u00a0spectrum disorder  he\u2019s on the spectrum  and\u2026 there were some signs early on  like\u2026 we went for a walk about a year ago  and i fell  and kinda nine out of ten people would go  \u201coh  my god  are you okay \u201d right  maybe more like ten out of ten people  \u201coh  my god  are you okay \u201d but instead  my husband went\u2026 he kind of froze and became a lighthouse  opening and closing his mouth  just\u2026 and i remember lying on the ground looking up at him  and i wasn\u2019t mad  i just thought  \u201chuh \u201d a lot of \u201chuh\u201d moments  you know  and once he was diagnosed  it dawned on me how funny it was because all of the characteristics that make it\u00a0clear that he\u2019s on the spectrum are all\u00a0of the reasons that i fell madly in love\u00a0with him  that\u2019s the truth  he says whatever is on his mind  he keeps it so real  you know  he doesn\u2019t\u00a0care about social norms or what you\u00a0expect him to say or do  you know  if i say to him  like  \u201cdoes this look like shit \u201d he\u2019ll go  \u201cyeah  you have a lot of other clothes  why don\u2019t you wear those \u201d i\u2019m like\u2026 \u201cokay \u201d but he can also make me feel more beautiful than anyone ever has\u00a0my whole\u00a0life  yeah  it\u2019s true  and he can\u2019t lie  is that the dream man  a guy who can\u2019t lie  but that also means that he can\u2019t lie for\u00a0me  which is an essential part of any relationship  we\u2019re friends with this couple  and they broke up  and the guy started dating a new girl pretty soon after  and we happened to be at\u00a0the party where they got together  so i didn\u2019t rush to tell the\u00a0ex girlfriend what happened  so a couple of months later  we had dinner with her  and she was like  \u201cand  you know  at\u00a0that party  that\u2019s when they got together \u201d and i was like\u2026 \u201cno  it\u2019s not possible \u201d and chris goes\u2026 \u201cno  you remember \u201d \u201cno  no  i don\u2019t \u201d \u201cyeah  remember  \u2018cause you said  \u2018oh  my god  he\u2019s\u00a0leaving with her  \u201d \u201cthank you  chris  thank you  i guess i forgot about that \u201d also  one of the the signs of autism is you don\u2019t make sort of the\u2026 appropriate facial expression for the\u00a0occasion you\u2019re at  so we were gonna go on a red carpet together for the first time  and we were practicing his\u00a0smiles  you know  and we didn\u2019t land on one that we were in love with  so we were out of time  so i said  \u201cjust\u2026 this is what i do \u00a0just think about something you love \u00a0you know \u201d and he loves the ocean  so\u2026 so we went out there and it worked  but it worked too well  \u2018cause in all the pictures  i\u2019m doing my normal bullshit  and he\u00a0was like\u2026 i noticed  i was like  \u201ca pond  just like\u00a0you\u2019re glancing at a pond  pull it back \u201d it\u2019s exciting being pregnant  it\u2019s not all bad  the best part about it is not getting your period  yeah  that\u2019s the silver uterine lining  if you want to look for one  that\u2019s nice because \u00a0you know  what i realized  right before i got pregnant  i\u00a0noticed\u2026 how ashamed\u2026 we\u2019ve all been made to feel about getting\u00a0our period\u2026 our whole lives  like we choose it  you\u00a0know  like  \u201ccan\u2019t kick my bleeding habit  you know  i just want it  i want to do it \u201d it\u2019s supposed to be  you know  a secret  the second you get it  your mom goes  \u201cyou\u2019re a woman now  and that\u2019s disgusting  never let anyone know of your filthy secret \u201d and you\u2019re like  \u201cokay  i\u2019m    i\u2019m ready to handle this \u201d this is my rainbow brite lunch box  \u266a rainbow brite stars are shining bright \u266a and it is  that\u2019s the most embarrassing\u00a0thing that could possibly happen to you as a kid  that someone knows you have your period  or they see you have your period  at that age  for men  the most\u00a0embarrassing thing is unwanted erections \u00a0right  but then they grow up and show them to\u00a0everyone  maybe that\u2019s what we should do  i don\u2019t know  call a coworker into your office  \u201ccarl\u2026 psst  come in here  close the door \u201d \u201ccarl  you\u2019re getting very sleepy \u201d all this talk about dick pics  how about a tamp pic  you up  if you\u2019re still in a position where you\u2019re getting dick pics  ladies  i have a\u00a0suggestion for you  when you get a dick\u00a0pic\u2026 send back\u2026 a dick pic  you go  \u201coh  i\u2019m sorry  i thought we were exchanging our favorite\u00a0dick pics  dick for dick  pic for pic  no  i thought\u2026\u201d why are we made to feel so ashamed of a natural bodily function that ultimately brings life  you know  it\u2019s like\u2026 if you\u00a0forget a tampon  you have to bum one from\u00a0somebody  what we all do is  first  you look around\u2026 like you\u2019re going to say something racist  just like\u2026 and whatever race you thought i meant  that\u2019s your problem  and\u2026 then you kind of lean in  and we don\u2019t even say the whole sentence  we kind of go\u2026 \u201cdoes anybody have a\u2026\u201d \u201ctampon \u201d what is this  what\u2019s the claw  that\u2019s how disgusted we are with ourselves  \u201cdoes anyone have a tampon \u201d and i notice myself do it  i was in a gym locker room  thank you \u00a0and\u2026 and there were a bunch of women in there  and i\u2026 and this woman across the locker room with so much confidence was like  \u201coh  yeah  i do  what size \u201d and  like  obviously  i know there are different sizes of\u00a0tampons  but i\u2019ve never been confronted\u2026 \u2026with that question before  you know  she\u2019s like  \u201cyeah  what\u2019s the circumference of your pussy hole  grande or venti  what are we plugging  bitch  i\u2019ve got pilates  what is it \u201d then all the other women in the locker room kinda lean in to hear\u2026 \u2026my answer  you know  i\u2019m just like\u2026 \u201ci don\u2019t know  do you have  like

so\u2026 it probably would have been like that before i was pregnant  but that just\u00a0doubled it  so the whole way down\u2026 and  you know  we get down there  and\u2026 it was\u00a0really intense and really emotional  and\u2026 we were gonna get arrested on the capitol steps  but they barricaded those  so we all rush into the hart building  where the senators\u2019 offices are  and we all flood in this hallway  and  you know  the banners are flying and the\u00a0capitol police are closing in  and we know we\u2019re about to be arrested  and everyone\u2019s chanting  \u201cno justice  no
