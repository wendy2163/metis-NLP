## Design
The project goal is to explore the topics within comedy and understand if there’s any difference between male and female comedians. It also measures how one comedian’s style is different or similar to another one. 

The insights can be used for organizing comedy events. A planner can choose the order of performance based on the similarity distance. 


## Data 
The data is scraped from a website. The dataset includes seventeen comedian names, gender and the seventeen full script of their stand ups. Each script contains at least 6000 words. In the columns, the data contains comedian name, gender and script. Each row is a full comedy transcript. The data size after CountVectorizer is 17 rows x 8878 columns (words)
